<p class="center larger">OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</p>

<p>“Most certainly the above title is no misnomer, for the ‘Handy Horse-Book’
is a manual of driving, riding, and the general care and management
of horses, evidently the work of no unskilled hand.”—<i>Bell’s Life.</i></p>

<p>“As cavalry officer, hunting horseman, coach proprietor, whip, and
steeplechase rider, the author has had long and various experience in the
management of horses, and he now gives us the cream of his information
in a little volume, which will be to horse-keepers and horse-buyers all that
the ‘Handy Book on Property Law,’ by Lord St Leonards, has for years
past been to men of business. It does not profess to teach the horse-keeper
everything that concerns the beast that is one of the most delicate
as well as the noblest of animals; but it supplies him with a number
of valuable facts, and puts him in possession of leading principles.”—<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

<p>“The writer shows a thorough knowledge of his subject, and he fully
carries out the object for which he professes to have undertaken his task—namely,
to render horse-proprietors independent of the dictations of ignorant
farriers and grooms.”—<i>Observer.</i></p>

<p>“We need only say that the work is essentially a <i>multum in parvo</i>, and
that a book more practically useful, or that was more required, could not
have possibly been written.”—<i>Irish Times.</i></p>

<p>“He propounds no theories, but embodies in simple and untechnical
language what he has learned practically; and a perusal of the volume
will at once testify that he is fully qualified for the task; and so skilfully
is the matter condensed that there is scarcely a single sentence which does
not convey sound and valuable information.”—<i>Sporting Gazette.</i></p>

<p>“We can cordially recommend it as a book especially suited to the general
public, and not beneath the attention of ‘practical men.’”—<i>The Globe.</i></p>

<p>“Contains a very great modicum of information in an exceedingly small
space.... There can be little doubt that it will, when generally
known, become the established <i>vade mecum</i> of the fox-hunter, the country
squire, and the trainer.”—<i>Army and Navy Gazette.</i></p>

<p>“A useful little work.... In the first part he gives just the
amount of information that will enable a man to work his horse comfortably,
check his groom, and generally know what he is about when riding,
driving, or choosing gear.”—<i>Spectator.</i></p>

<p>“This is a book to be read and re-read by all who take an interest in the
noble animal, as it contains a most comprehensive view of everything appertaining
to horse-flesh; and is, moreover, as fit for the library and drawing-room
as it is for the mess-table or the harness-room.”—<i>Sporting Magazine.</i></p>

<p>“By all means buy the book; it will repay the outlay.”—<i>Land and Water.</i></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE.</h2>

</div>

<p>Finding myself a standing reference among my
friends and acquaintance on matters relating to
horse-flesh, and being constantly in the habit of
giving them advice verbally and by letter, I have
been induced to comply with repeated suggestions
to commit my knowledge to paper, in the shape of
a Treatise or Manual.</p>

<p>When I say that my experience has been practically
tested on the road, in the field, on the turf
(having been formerly a steeplechase rider, as well
as now a hunting horseman), with the ribbons,
and in a cavalry regiment, I must consider that,
with an ardent taste for everything belonging to
horses thus nourished for years, I must either
have sadly neglected my opportunities, or have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
picked up some knowledge of the use and treatment
of the animal in question.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Born and bred, I may say, in constant familiarity
with a racing-stable, and having been
always devotedly attached to horses, the wrongs
of those noble animals have been prominently
before my eyes, and I have felt an anxious desire
to see justice done to them, which, I am sorry
to say, according to my observation, is but too
seldom the case; indeed, I have often marvelled
at the tractability of those powerful creatures
under the most perverted treatment by their
riders and drivers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span></p>

<p>My object, therefore, in offering the following
remarks, is not to trench upon the sphere of the
professional veterinary surgeon or riding-master,
but to render horse-proprietors independent of the
dictation of ignorant farriers and grooms. Intending
this little work merely as a useful manual,
I have purposely avoided technicalities, as belonging
exclusively to the professional man, and endeavoured
to present my dissertations on disease
in the most comprehensive terms possible, proposing
only simple remedies as far as they go; though,
for the satisfaction of my readers, I may mention
that, as an amateur, I have myself devoted much
time and thought to the study of anatomy, and
that any treatment of disease herein recommended
has been carefully perused and approved by a
veterinary surgeon. Theories are excluded, and I
confine myself simply to practical rules founded on
my own experience.</p>

<p>Hints and remarks are here offered to the general
public, which, to practical men, will appear trifling
and unnecessary; but keen and extended observation,
carried on as opportunity offered, amongst all
classes and in many countries and climates, has
given me an insight into the want of reasoning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
exhibited by men of every station in dealing with
the noble and willing inmates of the stable, and
has assisted in suggesting the necessity for just
such A B C instructions as are herein presented
by the Public’s very humble servant,</p>

<p class="right">“MAGENTA.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<h3>PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.</h3>

<p>Increased attention having been directed to the
necessity for greater vigilance with regard to the
breeding and production of good and useful horses,
many readers have expressed a wish that I would
give some decided views on these subjects; and
concurring with them as to the exigency of the
case, I have ventured, in an additional chapter in
this new and Third Edition, to make a few remarks,
which, although doubtless patent to practical
men, are naturally looked for by the public in this
Manual, which has been so favourably received.</p>

<h3>PREFACE TO FOURTH EDITION.</h3>

<p>The Third Edition of this little work, published
so recently as April last, being already out of
print, the Author, in presenting a new one, feels
called upon gratefully to acknowledge this unusual
mark of favour on the part of the public.</p>

<h3>BREEDING.</h3>

<p>A few words only of observation would I make on this
subject.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Palpably our horses, especially racers and
hunters, are degenerating in size and power, owing
mainly, it is to be feared, to the parents being selected
more for the reputation they have gained as winners
carrying feather-weights, than for any symmetrical
development or evidence of enduring power under the
weight of a man. We English might take a useful
lesson in selecting parental stock from the French, who
reject our theory of breeding from animals simply because
they have reputation in the racing calendars, and
who breed from none but those which have <i>shape</i> and
<i>power</i>, as well as blood and performance, to recommend
them. They are also particular to avoid using for stud
purposes such animals as may exhibit indications of any
<i>constitutional unsoundness</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span></p>

<h3>SELECTING.</h3>

<p>In selecting an animal, the character of the work for
which he is required should be taken into consideration.
For example, in choosing a hack, you will consider
whether he is for riding or for draught. In
choosing a hunter, you must bear in mind the peculiar
nature of the country he will have to contend with.</p>

<p>A horse should at all times have sufficient <i>size</i> and
power for the weight he has to move. It is an act of
cruelty to put a small horse, be his courage and breeding
ever so good, to carry a heavy man or draw a heavy
load. With regard to colour, some sportsmen say, and
with truth, that “a good horse can’t be a bad colour,
no matter what his shade.” Objection may, however,
be reasonably made to pie-balls, skew-balls, or cream-colour,
as being too conspicuous,—moreover, first-class
animals of these shades are rare; nor are the roan or
mouse-coloured ones as much prized as they should be.</p>

<p>Bay, brown, or dark chestnuts,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> black or grey horses,
are about the most successful competitors in the market,
and may be preferred in the order in which they are
here enumerated. Very light chestnut, bay, and white
horses are said to be irritable in temper and delicate in
constitution.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span></p>

<p>Mares are objected to by some as being occasionally
uncertain in temper and vigour, and at times unsafe in
harness, from constitutional irritation. More importance
is attached to these assumed drawbacks than
they deserve; and though the price of the male is
generally from one-fourth to one-sixth more than that
of the female, the latter will be found to get through
ordinary work quite as well as the former.</p>

<p><i>To judge of the Age by the Teeth.</i>—The permanent
nippers, or front teeth, in the lower jaw, are six. The
two front teeth are cut and placed at from two to three
years of age; the next pair, at each side of the middle
ones, at from three and a half to four; and the corner
pair between four and a half and five years of age,
when the tusks in the male are also produced.</p>

<p>The marks or cavities in these nippers are effaced in
the following order:—At six years old they are worn
out in the two centre teeth, at seven in the next
pair, and at eight in the corner ones, when the horse is
described as “aged.”</p>

<p>After this, as age advances, these nippers appear to
change gradually year by year from an oval to a more
detached and triangular form, till at twenty their appearance
is completely triangular. After six the tusks
become each year more blunt, and the grooves, which
at that age are visible inside, gradually wear out.</p>

<p><i>The Hack to Ride.</i>—A horse with a small well-shaped
head seldom proves to be a bad one; therefore such, with
small fine ears, should be sought in the first instance.</p>

<p>It is particularly desirable that the shoulder of a
riding hack should be light and well-placed. A high-withered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
horse is by no means the best for that purpose.
Let the shoulder-blades be well slanted as the horse
stands, their points light in front towards the chest.
Nor should there be too wide a front; for such width,
though well enough for draught, is not necessary in a
riding-horse, provided the chest and girth be <i>deep</i>.</p>

<p>As a matter of course the animal should be otherwise
well formed, with rather long pasterns (before but not
behind),—the length of which increases the elasticity of
his movement on hard roads. His action should be independent
and high, bending the knees. If he cannot
walk well—in fact, with action so light that, as the
dealers say, “he’d hardly break an egg if he trod on
it”—raising his legs briskly off the ground, when
simply led by the halter (giving him his head)—in
other words, if he walks “close to the ground”—he
should be at once rejected.</p>

<p>With regard to the other paces, different riders have
different fancies: the trot and walk I consider to be
the only important paces for a gentleman’s ordinary
riding-horse. It is very material, in selecting a riding-horse,
to observe how he holds his head in his various
paces; and to judge of this the intending purchaser
should remark closely how he works on the bit when
ridden by the rough-rider, and he should also pay particular
attention to this point when he is himself on his
back, before selection is made.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p class="caption">THE HACK</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span></p>

<p>Respecting soundness, though feeling fully competent
myself to judge of the matter, I consider the half-guinea
fee to a veterinary surgeon well-laid-out money,
to obtain his professional opinion and a certificate of
the state of an animal, when purchasing a horse of any
value.</p>

<p><i>The Hack for Draught</i> ought to be as well formed as
the one just described; but a much heavier shoulder and
forehand altogether are admissible.</p>

<p>No one should ever for a moment think of putting
any harness-horse into a private vehicle, no matter what
his seller’s recommendation, without first having him
out in a single or double break, as the case may be,
and seeing him driven, as well as driving him himself,
to make acquaintance with the animal—in fact, <i>to find
him out</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Hunter</i>, like the hack, should be particularly
well-formed before the saddle. He should be deep in
the girth, strong in the loins, with full development of
thigh, short and flat in the canon joint from the knee
to the pastern, with large flat hocks and sound fore
legs. This animal, like the road-horse, should lift his
feet clear of the ground and walk independently, with
evidence of great propelling power in the hind legs
when put into a canter or gallop.</p>

<p>A differently-shaped animal is required for each kind
of country over which his rider has to be carried. In
the midland counties and Yorkshire, the large three-quarter
or thorough-bred horse only will be found to
have pace and strength enough to keep his place. In
close countries, such as the south, south-west, and part<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
of the north of England, a plainer-bred and closer-set
animal does best.</p>

<p>In countries where the fences are height jumps—a
constant succession of timber, or stone walls—one must
look for a certain angularity of hip, not so handsome in
appearance, but giving greater leverage to lift the hind
legs over that description of fence.</p>

<p>A hunter should be all action; for if the rider finds
he can be carried safely across country, he will necessarily
have more confidence, and go straighter, not
therefore requiring so much pace to make up for round-about
“gating” gaps and “craning.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<h3>BUYING.</h3>

<p>If you propose purchasing from a dealer, take care
to employ none but a respectable man. It is also well
to get yourself introduced to such a one, by securing
the good offices of some valuable customer of his for
the purpose; for such an introduction will stimulate
any dealer who values his character to endeavour by his
dealings to sustain it with his patron.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Auction.</i>—An auction is a dangerous place for the
uninitiated to purchase at. If, however, it should suit
you to buy in that manner, the best course to pursue
is to visit the stables on the days previous to the sale,
for in all well-regulated repositories the horses are in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
for private inspection from two to three days before
the auction-day. Taking, if possible, one good judge
with you, eschewing the opinions of all grooms and
others—in fact, fastening the responsibility of selection
on the one individual—make for yourself all the examination
you possibly can, in or out of stable, of the
animal you think likely to suit you. There is generally
<i>a way</i> of finding out some of the antecedents of the
horses from the men about the establishment.</p>

<p><i>Fairs.</i>—To my mind it is preferable to purchase at
fairs rather than at an auction: indeed, a judge will
there have much more opportunity of comparison than
elsewhere.</p>

<p><i>Private Purchase.</i>—In buying from a private gentleman
or acquaintance, it is not unusual to get a horse
on trial for three or four days. Many liberal dealers,
if they have faith in the animal they want to dispose
of, and in the intending purchaser, will permit the same
thing.</p>

<p><i>Warranty.</i>—As observed under the head of “Selecting,”
it is never wise to conclude the purchase of a
horse without having him examined by a professional
veterinary surgeon, and getting a certificate of his actual
state. If the animal be a high-priced one, a warranty
should be claimed from the seller as a <i>sine qua non</i>;
and if low-priced, a professional certificate is desirable,
stating the extent of unsoundness, for your own satisfaction.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<h3>STABLING.</h3>

<p><i>Ventilation</i> is a matter of the first importance in a
stable. The means of ingress and egress of air should
be always three or four feet higher than the range of
the horses’ heads, for two simple reasons: first, when
an animal comes in warm, it is not well to have cold
air passing directly on the heated surface of his body;
and, in the second place, the foul air, being the lightest,
always ascends, and you give it the readiest mode of
exit by placing the ventilation high up. The common
louver window, which can never be completely closed, is
the best ordinary ventilator.</p>

<p><i>Drainage</i> ought to be closely investigated. The
drains should run so as to remove the traps or grates
outside the stable, or as far as possible from the horses,
in order to keep the effluvium <i>away</i> from them. All
foul litter and mass should be removed frequently
during the day; straw and litter ought not to be allowed
to remain under a horse in the daytime, unless
it be considered expedient that he should rest lying
down, in which case let him be properly bedded and
kept as quiet as possible. In many cases the practice
of leaving a small quantity of litter in the stall is a
fine cloak for deposit and urine left unswept underneath,
emitting that noxious ammonia with which the
air of most stables is so disagreeably impregnated that
on entering them from the fresh air you are almost
stifled.</p>

<p>Masters who object to their horses standing on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
bare pavement can order that, after the stall is thoroughly
cleaned and swept out, a thin layer of straw
shall be laid over the stones during the daytime. In
dealers’ and livery stables, and indeed in some gentlemen’s,
the pavement is sanded over, which has a nice
appearance, and prevents slipping.</p>

<p>When the foul litter is abstracted, and the straw
bedding taken from under the horse, none of it should
be pushed away under the manger; let it be entirely
removed: and in fair weather, or where a shed is available,
the bedding should be shaken out, to thoroughly
dry and let the air pass through it.</p>

<p>Wheaten is more durable than oaten straw for litter:
but the fibre of the former is so strong that it will
leave marks on the coat of a fine-skinned animal wherever
it may be unprotected by the clothing; however,
this is not material.</p>

<p><i>Light</i> should be freely admitted into stables, not
only that the grooms may be able to see to clean the
horses properly, and to do all the stable-work, but if
horses are kept in the dark it is natural that they
should be more easily startled when they go into full
daylight,—and such is always the consequence of badly-lighted
stables. Of course, if a horse is ailing, and
sleep is absolutely necessary for him, he should be
placed separate in a dark quiet place.</p>

<p><i>Stalls</i> should be wide, from six to seven feet across
if possible, yielding this in addition to other advantages,
that if the partitions are extended by means of
bars to the back wall, either end stall can be turned
into a loose-box sufficiently large to serve in an emergency.</p>

<p><i>A Loose-Box</i> is unquestionably preferable to a stall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
(in which a horse is tied up all the time he is not at
work in nearly the same position), and is indispensable
in cases of illness. Loose-boxes should be paved with
narrow bricks; and when prepared for the reception of
an animal whose shoes have been removed, the floor
should be covered with sawdust or tan, or either of
these mixed with fine sandy earth, or, best of all, peat-mould
when procurable,—any of which, where the indisposition
is confined to the feet <i>only</i>, may be kept
slightly moistened with water to cool them.</p>

<p>In cases of general illness, straw should be used for
bedding; and where the poor beast is likely to injure
himself in paroxysms of pain, the walls or partitions
should be well padded in all parts within his reach, and
as a further precaution let the door be made to open
outwards, and be fastened by a bolt, as latches sometimes
cause accidents.</p>

<p><i>Partitions</i> should be carried high enough towards the
head to prevent the horses from being able to bite one
another, or get at each other’s food.</p>

<p>With regard to stable-kickers, see the remarks on
this subject under the head of “Vice” (<a href="#Page_85">page 85</a>).</p>

<p><i>Racks and Mangers</i> are now made of iron, so that
horses can no longer gnaw away the manger piecemeal.
Another improvement is that of placing the rack on a
level with and beside the manger, instead of above the
horses’ heads; but notwithstanding this more reasonable
method of feeding hay when whole, it is far preferable
to give it as manger-food cut into chaff.</p>

<p><i>Flooring.</i>—In the construction of most stables a
cruel practice is thoughtlessly adopted by the way of
facilitating drainage (and in dealers’ stables to make
horses look large), viz., that of raising the paving towards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
the manger considerably above the level of the
rear part. It should be borne in mind that the horse
is peculiarly sensitive to any strain on the insertions of
the back or flexor tendons of his legs. Thus in stalls
formed as described, you will see the creature endeavouring
to relieve himself by getting his toes down between
the flags or stones (if the pavement will admit)
with the heels resting upon the edges of them; and if
the fastening to the head be long enough he will draw
back still farther, until he can get his toes down into
the drain-channel behind his stall, with the heels upon
the opposite elevation of the drain. Proper pavement
in your stable will help to alleviate a tendency towards
what is called “clap of the back sinew.”—<a href="#Page_143">See page
143.</a></p>

<p>The slope of an inch and a half or two inches is sufficient
for purposes of drainage in paving stables; but
if the drainage can be managed so as to allow of the
flooring being made quite level, so much the better.</p>

<p>Should my reader be disposed to build stabling, he
cannot do better than consult the very useful and practical
work entitled ‘Stonehenge, or the Horse in the
Stable and in the Field.’</p>

<p>The horse being a gregarious animal, and much
happier in society than alone, will, in the absence
of company of his own species, make friends with the
most sociable living neighbour he can find. A horse
should not be left solitary if it can be avoided.</p>

<p><i>Dogs</i> should never be kept in the stable with horses,
or be permitted to be their playfellows, on account of
the noxious emissions from their excrement. <i>Cats</i> are
better and more wholesome companions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<h3>GROOMING.</h3>

<p>I do not profess to teach grooms their business, but
to put masters on their guard against the common
errors and malpractices of that class; and with a view
to that end, two or three general rules are added which
a master would do well to enforce on a groom when
hiring him, as binding, under pain of dismissal.</p>

<p>1. Never to doctor a horse himself, but to acquaint
his master immediately with any accident, wound, or
symptom of indisposition about the animal, that may
come under his observation, and which, if in existence,
ought not to fail to attract the attention of a careful,
intelligent servant during constant handling of and attendance
on his charge.</p>

<p>2. Always to exercise the horses in the place appointed
by his master for the purpose, and <i>never</i> to
canter or gallop them.</p>

<p>3. To stand by while a horse is having its shoes
changed or removed, and see that any directions he
may have received on the subject are carried out.</p>

<p>4. Never to clean a horse out of doors.</p>

<p>These rules are recommended under a just appreciation
of that golden one, “Prevention is better than
cure.”</p>

<p>If the master is satisfied with an ill-groomed horse,
nine-tenths of the grooms will be so likewise; therefore
he may to a great extent blame himself if his bearer’s
dressing is neglected.</p>

<p>Grooms are especially fond of using water in cleaning
the horse (though often rather careful how they use
it with themselves, either inside or out): it saves them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
trouble, to the great injury of the animal. The same
predominating laziness which prompts them to use
water for the removal of mud, &amp;c., in preference to
employing a dry wisp or brush for the purpose, forbids
their exerting themselves to employ the proper means
of drying the parts cleaned by wet. They will have
recourse to any expedient to dry the skin rather than
the legitimate one of friction. Over the body they will
place cloths to soak up the wet; on the legs they will
roll their favourite bandages. It is best, therefore, to
forbid the use of water above the hoof for the purpose
of cleaning—except with the mane and tail, which
should be properly washed with soap and water occasionally.</p>

<p>When some severe work has been done, so as to
occasion perspiration, the ears should not be more
neglected than the rest of the body; and when they
are dried by hand-rubbing and pulling, the horse will
feel refreshed.</p>

<p>As already recommended, cleaning out of doors should
be forbidden. If one could rely on the discretion of
servants, cleaning might be done outside occasionally in
fine weather; but licence on this score being once given,
the probability is that your horse will be found shivering
in the open air on some inclement day.</p>

<p>The groom always uses a picker in the process of
washing and cleaning the feet, to dislodge all extraneous
matter, stones, &amp;c., that may have been picked up
in the clefts of the frog and thereabouts; he also washes
the foot with a long-haired brush. In dry weather,
after heavy work, it is good to stop the fore feet with
what is called “stopping” (cow-dung), which is not
difficult to procure. Wet clay is sometimes used in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
London for the purpose in the absence of cow-dung.
Very useful, too, in such case will be found a stopping
composed of one part linseed-meal to two parts bran,
wetted, and mixed to a sticking consistency.</p>

<p>The evidence of care in the groomed appearance of
the mane and tail looks well. An occasional inspection
of the mane by the master may be desirable, by turning
over the hairs to the reverse side; any signs of dirt or
dandriff found cannot be creditable to the groom.</p>

<p><i>Bandaging.</i>—When a hunter comes in from a severe
day, it is an excellent plan to put <i>rough</i> bandages (provided
for the purpose) on the legs, leaving them on
while the rest of the body is cleaning; it will be found
that the mud and dirt of the legs will to a great extent
fall off in flakes on their removal, thus reducing the
time employed in cleaning. When his legs are cleaned
and well hand-rubbed, put on the usual-sized flannel
bandages. They should never remain on more than
four or six hours, and when taken off (not to be again
used till the next severe work) the legs should be once
more hand-rubbed.</p>

<p>Bandages ought not to be used under other circumstances
than the above, except by order of a veterinary
surgeon for unsoundness.</p>

<p>In some cases of unsoundness—such as undue distension
of the bursæ, called “wind-galls,” the effect of
work—a linen or cotton bandage kept continually
saturated with water, salt and water, or vinegar, and
not much tightened, may remain on the affected legs;
but much cannot be said for the efficacy of the treatment.</p>

<p>For what is called “clap,” or supposed distension of
the back sinew (which is in reality no distension of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
the tendon, as that is said to be impossible, though
some of its fibres may be injured, but inflammation of
the sheath through which the tendon passes), the cold
lotion bandaging just described, in connection with the
directions given under the head of “Shoeing” (<a href="#Page_82">page
82</a>), will be found very serviceable.</p>

<p><i>Grooms’ Requisites</i> are usually understood to comprise
the following articles:—a body-brush, water-brush,
dandriff or “dander” brush, picker, scraper,
mane-comb, curry-comb, pitchfork, shovel and broom,
manure-basket, chamois-leather, bucket, sponges, dusters,
corn-sieve, and measures; leather boot for poultices,
clyster syringe (requiring especial caution in use—<a href="#Footnote_36"><i>see</i>
page 159, note</a>), drenching-horn, bandages (woollen
and linen); a box with a supply of stopping constantly
at hand; a small store of tow and tar, most
useful in checking the disease called thrush (<a href="#Page_135">page 135</a>)
before it assumes a chronic form; a lump of rock-salt,
ready to replace those which should be always kept in
the mangers to promote the general health of the animals
as well as to amuse them by licking it; a lump of
chalk, ready at any time for use (in the same manner
as rock-salt) in the treatment of some diseases, as described,
<a href="#Page_154">pages 154</a> and <a href="#Page_160">160</a>.</p>

<p><i>Singeing</i>, there is little doubt, tends to improve the
condition of the animal; so much so, that timid users
do well to remember that animals which, before the
removal of their winter coat, required perpetual reminders
of the whip, will, directly they are divested of that
covering, evince a spirit, vigour, and endurance which
had remained, perhaps, quite unsuspected previously.
In fact, in most cases, the general health and appetite
seem to be improved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>Singeing, when severe rapid work is done, enables
the horse to perform his task with less distress, and
when it is over, facilitates his being made comfortable
in the shortest possible space of time.</p>

<p>Singeing, if done early in the winter, requires to be
repeated lightly three or four times during the season.</p>

<p><i>Clipping</i> has exactly the same effect as the above,
and is preferable to it only in cases where, the animal’s
coat being extremely long, extra labour, loss of time,
and flame, are avoided by the clipping process. Singeing
is best with the lighter coats, but sometimes thin
skinned and coated animals are too nervous and excitable
to bear the flame near them for this purpose, in
which case the cause of alarm ought obviously to be
avoided, and clipping resorted to.</p>

<p>It is worth while to employ the best manipulators to
perform these operations.</p>

<p>With horses intended for slow and easy work, and
liable to continued exposure to the weather, singeing or
clipping only the under part of the belly, and the long
hairs of the legs, will suffice. Unless neatly and tastily
done, this is very unsightly on a gentleman’s horse.
Clipping, if not done till the beginning of December,
seldom requires repetition.</p>

<p>In stony and rough countries, it is the habit of judicious
horsemen to leave the hair on their hunters’ legs
from the knees and hocks down, as a protection to
them.</p>

<h3>HALTERING.</h3>

<p><i>The Head-Stall</i> should fit a horse, and have a proper
brow-band; it is ridiculous to suppose that the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
sized one can suit all heads. Ordinary head-stalls have
only one buckle, which is on the throat-lash near-side;
and if the stall be made to <i>fit</i>, that is sufficient. <i>Otherwise</i>
there should be three buckles, one on each side of
the cheek-straps, besides the one on the throat-lash.</p>

<p>Let the fastening from the head-stall to the log be
of rope or leather. Chain fastenings are objectionable,
because, besides being heavy, they are very apt to catch
in the ring, and they make a fearful noise, especially
where there are many horses in the stable. By having
rope or leather as a fastener, instead of chain, the log
may be lighter (of wood instead of iron), and the less
weight there is to drag the creature’s head down, the
less the distress to him. Poll-evil (<a href="#Page_117">page 117</a>), it is said,
has frequently resulted from the pressure of the head-stall
on the poll, occasioned by heavy pendants.</p>

<p>Chains are more durable, and that is all that can be
said in their favour, except that they may be necessary
for a few vicious devils who are up to the trick of severing
the rope or leather with their teeth.</p>

<p>See that the log is sufficiently heavy to keep the rope
or leather at stretch, and that the manger-ring is large
enough to allow the fastening to pass freely. If the
log is too light, or the manger-ring too small, the likely
result will be that the log will remain close up under
the ring, the fastening falling into a sort of loop,
through which the horse most probably introduces his
foot, and, in his consequent alarm and efforts to disentangle
his legs, chucks up his head, and away he goes
on his side, gets “<i>halter-cast</i>,” most likely breaks one
of his hind legs in his struggles to regain his footing, or
at least dislocates one of their joints.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<h3>CLOTHING.</h3>

<p>Opinions differ materially as to the amount of clothing
that ought to be used in the stable. My view of the
matter is, that a stable being, as it should be, thoroughly
ventilated, necessitates the horses in it being to a certain
extent kept warm by clothing. An animal that
has not been divested of his own coat by clipping or
singeing, will require very little covering indeed; for
nature’s provision, being sufficient to protect him out of
doors, ought surely to suffice in the stable, with a very
slight addition of clothing. If he has been clipped or
singed, covering enough to make up for what he has
lost ought to be ample: by going beyond this the
horse is only made tender, and more susceptible of the
influences of the atmosphere when he comes to be exposed
to it with only a saddle on his back.</p>

<p>In parts of North America, I have observed, where
the stables are built roughly of wood, with many fissures
to admit the weather, horses are seldom, if ever,
sheeted. They are certainly rarely divested of their
coats; but during work, as occasion may require, it is
usual for the rider, when stopping at any place, to leave
his horse “hitched” (as they call it) to any convenient
post or tree, in all weathers, and for any length of time,
and these horses scarcely ever catch cold.</p>

<p>The best <i>Sheet</i> is formed of a rug (sizeable enough to
meet across the breast and extend to the quarters), by
simply cutting the slope of the neck out of it, and fastening
the points across the breast by two straps and
buckles.</p>

<p>The <i>Hood</i> need only be used when the horse is at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
walking exercise, or likely to be exposed to weather, or
for the purpose of sweating, when a couple of them,
with two or three sheets, may be used.—<a href="#Page_32"><i>See</i> page 32.</a></p>

<p>Horse-clothing should be, at least once a-week, taken
<i>outside</i> the stable, and well beaten and <i>shaken</i> like a
carpet.</p>

<p><i>Rollers</i> should be looked to from time to time, to see
that the pads of the roller <i>do not meet within three or
four inches</i> (over the backbone),—in other words, there
should be always a clear channel over it, nearly large
enough to pass the handle of a broom through, so as to
avoid the possibility of the upper part of the roller even
touching the sheet over the spinal ridge, which, if permitted,
will be sure to cause a sore back, to the great
injury of the horse and his master, arousing vicious
habits in the former to resent any touch, necessary or
unnecessary, of the sore place on so sensitive a part,
and rendering him irritable when clothing, saddling,
or harnessing, or if a hand even approach the tender
place.</p>

<p>This is so troublesome a consequence of not paying
attention to the padding of rollers, that a master will do
well to examine them himself for his own satisfaction.</p>

<p><i>Knee-Caps.</i>—On all occasions when a valuable horse
is taken by a servant on road or rail, his knees should
be protected by caps. The only way to secure them is
to fasten them tightly <i>above</i> the knee, where elastic
straps are decidedly preferable, leaving the fastening
below the knee slack.</p>

<p><i>A Leather Boot</i>, lined with sponge, or one of felt with
a strong leather sole, should be ready in every stable to
be used as required, in cases of sudden foot-lameness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<h3>FEEDING.</h3>

<p>The cavalry allowances are 12 lb. hay, 10 lb. oats,
and 8 lb. straw daily, which, I know by experience, will
keep a healthy animal in condition with the work required
from a dragoon horse, of the severity of which
none but those acquainted with that branch of the service
have any idea.</p>

<p>Until he is perfectly fit for the ranks, between riding-school,
field-days, and drill, the troop-horse has quite
work enough for any beast. I may add that few horses
belonging to officers of cavalry get more than the above
allowance, unless when <i>regularly</i> hunted, in which case
additional corn and beans are given.</p>

<p>With severe work, 14 lb. to 16 lb. of oats, and 12
lb. of hay, which is the general allowance in well-regulated
hunting-stables, ought to be sufficient. Beans
are also given in small quantity.</p>

<p>Some persons feed their horses three times a-day,
but it is better to divide their food into four daily
portions, watering them, at least half an hour before
each feed.</p>

<p>The habit which some grooms have of feeding while
they are teazing an animal with the preliminaries of
cleaning, is very senseless, as the uneasiness horses are
sure to exhibit under anything like grooming causes
them to knock about their heads and scatter their food.
On a journey, according to the call upon the system by
the increased amount of work, so should the horse’s
feeding be augmented by one-third, one-fourth, or one-half
more than usual. A few beans or pease may well
be added under such circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>In stables where the stalls are divided by bales or
swinging-bars, the horses when feeding should have
their heads so tied as to prevent them from consuming
their neighbour’s food, or the result would be that the
greedy or more rapid eaters would succeed in devouring
more than their fair share, while the slower feeders
would have to go on short commons.</p>

<p><i>Oats</i> ought <i>always</i> to be <i>bruised</i>, as many horses,
whether from greediness in devouring their food, or
from their teeth being incapable of grinding, swallow
them whole; and it is a notorious fact that oats, unless
masticated, pass right through the animal undigested.</p>

<p>When supplies have been very deficient with forces
in the field, the camp-followers have been known to
exist upon the grain extracted from the droppings of
the horses.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that not more than at the
utmost two days’ consumption of oats should be bruised
at a time, as they soon turn sour in that state, and are
thus unfit for the use of that most delicate feeder, the
horse. All oats before being bruised should be well
sifted, to dispose of the gravel and dust which are always
present in the grain as it comes from the farmer.
Unbruised oats, if ever used, should be similarly prepared
before being given in feed.</p>

<p><i>Hay</i> ought always to be cut into chaff or may be
mixed with the corn, which is the only way to insure
the proper proportion being given at a feed. When the
hay is not cut but fed from the rack, never more than
3 lb. should be put in the rack at a time. If desirable
to give as much as 12 lb. daily, let the rack be filled
six times in twenty-four hours.</p>

<p><i>Beans</i> must be invariably split or bruised. It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
better to give a higher price for English beans than to
use the Egyptian at any price; the latter are said to be
impregnated with the eggs of insects, which adhere to
the lining of the horse’s stomach, causing him serious
injury. In India horses are principally fed on a kind
of small pea called “gram”—in the United States their
chief food is maize; the oat-plant not succeeding well
in either of those regions.</p>

<p><i>Bran.</i>—Food should be varied occasionally, and all
horses not actually in training ought to have a bran-mash
once a-week. The best time to give this is for the
first feed after the work is done, on the day preceding
the rest day, whenever that may be.</p>

<p>Even hunters, after a hard day, will eat the bran
with avidity, and it is well to give it for the first meal.
Its laxative qualities render it a sedative and cooler in
the half-feverish state of system induced by the exertion
and excitement of the chase; and according to my
experience, if given just after the work is done, the
digestive process, relaxed by the bran, has full time to
recover itself by the grain-feeding before the next call
is made on the horse’s powers. If the bran is not
liked, a little bruised oats may be mixed through it to
tempt the palate. Whole grains of oats should never be
mixed with bran, as they must of necessity be bolted
with the latter, and passed through the animal entire.</p>

<p><i>Mash.</i>—When only doing ordinary work, the following
mash should be given to each horse on Saturday
night after work, supposing your beasts to rest on
Sunday:—</p>

<p>Put half a pint of linseed in a two-quart pan with
an even edge; pour on it one quart of boiling water,
cover it close, and leave to soak for four hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>At the same time moisten half a bucket of bran with
a gallon of water. When the linseed has soaked for
four hours, a hole must be made in the middle of the
bran, and the linseed mass mixed into the bran mass.
The whole forms one feed. Should time be an object,
boil slowly half a pint of linseed in two quarts of
water, and add it to half a bucket of bran which had
been previously steeped for half an hour or an hour in
a gallon of water.</p>

<p>If a cold is present, or an animal is delicate, the bran
can be saturated with boiling water, of which a little
more can be added to warm it when given.</p>

<p><i>Carrots</i>, when a horse is delicate, will be found
acceptable, and are both nutritious and wholesome as
food. In spring and summer, when vetches or other
green food can be had, an occasional treat of that sort
conduces to health where the work is sufficiently moderate
to admit of soft feeding. When horses are coating
in spring or autumn, or weak from fatigue or
delicacy, the addition to their food of a little more
nutriment may be found beneficial. The English
white pea is milder and not so heating as beans, and
may be given half a pint twice daily, mixed with the
ordinary feeding, for from one to three or four weeks,
as may be deemed advisable.</p>

<p>When an animal is “off his feed,” as it is called, attention
should be immediately directed to his manger,
which is often found to be shamefully neglected, the
bottom of it covered with gravel, or perhaps the ends
and corners full of foul matter, such as the sour remains
of the last bran-mash and other half-masticated
leavings.</p>

<p>The introduction of any greasy or fetid matter into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
a horse’s food will effectually prevent this dainty
creature from touching it. It used to be a common
practice at hostelries in the olden time, to rub the
teeth of a traveller’s horse with a tallow candle or a
little oil; thus causing the poor beast to leave his food
untouched for the benefit of his unfeeling attendant.</p>

<p>Again, the oats or hay may be found, on close examination,
to be musty, which causes them to be rejected
by the beast.</p>

<p>Where no palpable cause for loss of appetite can be
discovered, reference should be made to a qualified
veterinary surgeon, who will examine the animal’s
mouth, teeth, and general state of health, and probably
report that the lining of the cheeks is highly inflamed
in some part, owing to undue angularity or decay of
the teeth, and he will know how to act accordingly.</p>

<p>When horses are on a journey, or a long ride home
after hunting, some people recommend the use of
gruel; but, from experience, I prefer giving a handful
of wetted hay in half a bucket of <i>tepid</i> water, or ale or
porter.—<a href="#Page_37"><i>See</i> page 37.</a></p>

<p><i>Feeding on Board Ship</i> should be confined to chaff
and bran, mixed with about one-fourth the usual quantity
of <i>bruised</i> oats.</p>

<p>Though horses generally look well when “full of
flesh,” there are many reasons why they should not be
allowed to become fat after the fashion of a farmer’s
“stall-feds.” Some really good grooms think this form
of condition the pink of perfection. They are mistaken.
An animal in such a state is quite unfit to travel at any
fast pace or bear continued exertion without injury,
and may therefore be considered so far useless.</p>

<p>He is also much more liable to contract disease, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
if attacked by such the constitution succumbs more
readily.</p>

<p>Moreover, the superfluous weight of the cumbrous
flesh and fat tends to increase the wear and tear of the
legs; and if the latter be at all light from the knee to
the pastern, they are more likely to suffer.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it may be well to observe, by way
of caution, that it is by no means good management to
let a horse become at any time reduced to <i>actual leanness</i>
through overwork or deficient feeding. <i>It is far
easier to pull down than to put up flesh</i>.</p>

<p>These hints on feeding may be closed with a remark,
that in all large towns <i>contractors</i> are to be found ready
and willing to enter into contract for feeding gentlemen’s
horses by the month or year. This is a very
desirable arrangement for masters, but one frequently
objected to by servants, who, however, in such cases
can easily be replaced by application to the dealer, he
having necessarily excellent opportunities of meeting
with others as efficient.</p>

<p>Contractors should not be allowed to supply more
than two or three days’ forage at a time.</p>

<h3>WATERING.</h3>

<p>Horses are greater epicures in water than is generally
supposed, and will make a rush for some favourite
spring or rivulet where water may have once proved
acceptable to their palate, when that of other drinking-places
has been rejected or scarcely touched.</p>

<p>The groom’s common maxim is to water twice a-day,
but there is little doubt that horses should have access<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
to water more frequently, being, like ourselves or any
other animal, liable from some cause—some slight derangement
of the stomach, for instance—to be more
thirsty at one time than another; and it is a well-known
fact that, where water is easily within reach,
these creatures never take such a quantity at a time as
to unfit them for <i>moderate work</i> at any moment. If
an arrangement for continual access to water be not
convenient, horses should be watered before every feed,
or at least thrice a-day, the first time being in the
morning, an hour before feeding (which hour will be
employed in grooming the beast); and it may be observed
that there is no greater aid to increasing their
disposition to put up flesh, than giving them as much
water as they like before and after every feed.</p>

<p>A horse should never be watered when heated, or on
the eve of any extraordinary exertion. Animals that
are liable to colic or gripes, or are under the effect of
medicines, particularly such as act on the alimentary
canal, and predispose to those affections, should get
water with the chill off.</p>

<p><i>Watering in Public Troughs</i>, or places where every
brute that travels the road has access, must be strictly
avoided. Glanders, farcy, and other infectious diseases
may be easily contracted in this way.</p>

<h3>GRAZING.</h3>

<p>The advantage of grazing, as a change for the better
in any, and indeed in every, case where the horse may
be thrown out of sorts by accident or disease, becomes
very questionable, on account of the <i>artificial state</i> in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
which he must have been kept, to enable him to meet
the requirements of a master of the present day in
work. If the change be recommended to restore the
feet or legs, this object may be attained, and much
better, by keeping the creature in a loose-box without
shoes, on a floor covered with sawdust or tan, kept
damp as directed (<a href="#Page_10">page 10</a>), to counteract whatever
slight inflammation may be in the feet and legs, or,
best of all, covered with peat-mould, as this does not
require to be damped, and the animal can lie down on
it; besides, the properties of the peat neutralise the
noxious ammonia, and it does not consequently require
to be so often renewed. In the loose-box also he can
take quite as much exercise as is necessary for an invalid
intended to be laid up, and there he can be
supplied with whatever grain, roots, or succulent food
may be deemed necessary.</p>

<p>As for any other advantage to be derived from a run
at grass, unless for the purpose of using the herb as an
alterative, I never could see it: and even this end, unless
the horse has a paddock to himself, can hardly be
gained; for if there are too many beasts for the production
of the ground, the fare must be scanty, and each
animal half starved.</p>

<p>The disadvantages of changing a horse to grass from
the artificial state of condition are the following:—</p>

<p>1. That condition is sure to be lost (at least as far as
it is necessary to fit for work, especially to go across
country at a hunting pace, with safety to himself and
his rider), and not to be regained for a considerable
time, and at great cost.</p>

<p>2. The horse is exceedingly liable to meet with accident
from the playfulness or temper of his companions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>3. Worms of the most dangerous and pertinacious
description are picked up nowhere but at grass.</p>

<p>4. Many ailments are contracted from exposure and
hardship or bad feeding; and owing to the animal
being removed from under immediate inspection, such
ailments gain ground before they are observed. Moreover,
at grass the horse is more exposed to contagious
and epidemic diseases.</p>

<p>5. Horses suffer great annoyance from flies in summer
time, not having long tails like horned cattle to
reach every part of their body; and wherever any
superficial sore may be present, the flies are sure to find
it out.</p>

<p>As to aged animals, it is sheer cruelty (practised by
some masters with the best intentions and worst possible
results) to turn them out to grass. Such creatures
have probably been accustomed in the earlier part of
their lives to warm stables, their food put under their
noses, good grooming, and proper care. You might
just as well turn out a gentleman in his old age among
a tribe of friendly savages, unclad and unsheltered, to
exist upon whatever roots and fruits he could pick
up, as expose a highly-bred and delicately-nurtured
old horse to the vicissitudes and hardships of a life at
grass.</p>

<h3>TRAINING.</h3>

<h4>RAREY’S SYSTEM.</h4>

<p>The principle of this system is that of overpowering
the horse that may in some instances have even become
dangerous and useless, from having learned the secret<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
that <i>his strength gives him an advantage over his master</i>—man.
<i>Unconsciously</i> deprived of his power of
resistance, his courage vanishes; the spirit which rose
against all <i>accountable</i> efforts to subdue it, that would
scorn to yield to overweight, pace, work, or any other
<i>evidence</i> of man’s power, and which in the well-dispositioned
animal causes him to strain every nerve to
meet what is required of him rather than succumb, is
by Rarey’s system subdued through a ruse so effected
that the power which overwhelms all the creature’s
efforts at resistance appears to originate and be identified
with the man who can thus, for the first time, take
liberties with him, which he has lost the power of resenting;
and man thenceforward becomes his master.
The method pursued by Mr Rarey in subduing such
a vicious and ungovernable horse as Cruiser, is this:
Placing himself under a waggon laden with hay, to
which the animal is partly coaxed, partly led by guide-ropes,
and stealing his fingers through the spokes of
the waggon-wheel, he raises and gently straps up one
fore leg, and fastens a long strap round the fetlock of
the other, the end of which he holds in his hand and
checks when necessary. The beast, thus unconsciously
tampered with, is quite disposed to resent in his usual
style the subsequent impertinent familiarities of his
tamer; but being by the foregoing precautions cast
prostrate on his first attempt to move, and finding all
his efforts to regain his liberty and carry out reprisals
abortive, worn-out and hopeless, he at length yields
himself helplessly to his victor’s obliging attentions, of
sitting on him as he lies, drumming and fiddling in his
ears, &amp;c., and is thenceforward man’s obedient and
tractable servant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p>There is no doubt that Mr Rarey’s plan of thus
overcoming the unruly or vicious beast by mild but
effectual means, is the right one to gain the point, <i>as
far as it goes</i>; but breaking him in to saddle or draught,
improving his paces, or having ability in riding or driving
any horse judiciously, must be considered another
affair, and only to be acquired through more or less
competent instruction, and by practice combined with
taste.</p>

<p>In training, the use of a dumb jockey<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> will be
found most serviceable to get the head into proper
position, and to bend the neck. Two hours a-day in
this gear, while the horse is either loose in a box or
fastened to the pillar-reins if in a stall, will not at all
interfere with his regular training, exercise, or work,
and will materially aid the former result.</p>

<p>I greatly advocate the use of the dumb jockey without
springs, even with formed horses, who, being daily
used to it, need no such adjuncts as bearing-reins, but
will arch their necks, work nicely on the bit, and exhibit
an altered show and style in action that is very
admirable in a gentleman’s equipage.</p>

<p>Should my reader be much interested in breaking-in
rough colts, I recommend him to consult ‘Stonehenge,’
by J. H. Walsh, F.R.C.S., editor of the ‘Field.’</p>

<p><i>Training for Draught.</i>—Before the first trial in the
break-carriage, give your horse from half-an-hour to an
hour’s quiet ringing in the harness, to which he should
have been previously made accustomed by wearing it
for a couple of hours the two or three preceding days.
The first start should be in a regular break, or strong<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
but inexpensive vehicle, and stout harness, with also
saving-collar, knee-caps, and kicking-strap—no bearing-rein.
He should be led by ropes or reins (in single
harness on both sides of the head), and tried on a level,
or rather down than up a slight inclination. The place
selected should be one where there is plenty of unoccupied
roadway.</p>

<p>Better begin in double harness, and let the break-horse
with which the driver is to start the carriage
be strong and willing, so as to pull away the untried
one.</p>

<p><i>The Neck</i> usually suffers during the first few lessons
in training to harness; and until that part of it where
the collar wears becomes thoroughly hardened by use,
it should be bathed with a strong solution of salt and
water <i>before</i> the collar is taken off, that there may be
no mistake about its being done at once. Should there
be the least abrasion of the skin, do not use salt and
water, but a wash of 1 scruple chloride of zinc to 1 pint
of water, dabbed on the sore every two or three hours
with fine linen rag, and give rest from collar-work till
healed; then harden with salt and water; and when the
scab has disappeared, and the horse is fit for harness,
chamber the collar over the affected part, and employ
for a while a saving-collar. A sore neck will produce
a jibbing horse, and therefore requires to be closely attended
to in his training.</p>

<h3>EXERCISING.</h3>

<p>It is desirable that a master should appoint a particular
place for the exercising of his horses, coupled with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
strict injunctions to his groom on no account to leave
it. No master should give his servants the option of
going where they please to exercise, their favourite resort
being often the precincts of a public-house, with a
sharp gallop round the most impracticable corners to
make up the time. An occasional visit of the master
to the exercising ground is a very salutary check upon
such proceedings.</p>

<p>The best possible exercise for a horse is walking—the
sod or any soft elastic surface being better than the road
for the purpose; and if the latter only is available, use
knee-caps as a safeguard.</p>

<p>Two hours’ daily exercise (<i>if he gets it</i>) at a <i>fast</i> walk
will be enough to keep a hack fit for his work; and it
is usual with some experienced field-horsemen never to
allow their hunters, <i>when once up to their work</i>, to get
any but walking exercise for as much as four hours
daily, two hours at a time—that is, when they desire to
keep them “fit.”</p>

<p>Ladies’ and elderly gentlemen’s horses ought most
particularly to be exercised, and not overfed, to keep
them tame and tractable, and to guard against accidents.</p>

<p>The foregoing directions refer to the <i>preparations</i>
for the master’s work, and are what I should give my
groom.</p>

<p><i>Sweating.</i>—In case it is desirable to prepare an animal
for any extraordinary exertion, the readiest, safest,
and most judicious means is by sweating, carefully proceeded
with, by using two or three sets of body-clothes,
an empty stomach being indispensable for the process,
and a riding-school, if available, the best place for the
necessary exercise,—a sweat being thus sooner obtained
free from cold air, and the soft footing of such a place<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
saving the jar on the legs more even than the sod in
the field, unless it happen to be very soft.</p>

<p>Sweating is a peculiarly healthy process for either
man or beast; and to judge of the benefit derived by
a horse through that means, from the effect of a heavy
perspiration through exercise on one’s self, there seems
little doubt that it is very renewing to the <i>physique</i>.</p>

<p><i>Ringing</i> or <i>Loungeing</i> with a cavesson, though not
ordinarily adopted, except by the trainer, is nevertheless
most useful as a means of exercise. It is a very suitable
manner of “taking the rough edge off,” or bringing
down the superabundant spirits of horses that have
been confined to the stable for some time by weather or
other similar cause producing restiveness, and is peculiarly
adapted for exercising harness-horses where it
may not be safe or expedient to ride them.</p>

<h3>WORK.</h3>

<p>The master on the road or in the field using his
bearer for convenience or pleasure, will do him less
injury in a day than a thoughtless ignorant servant will
contrive to accomplish in an hour when only required
to exercise the beast.</p>

<p>To the advice already given, never to allow your
horses to be galloped or cantered on a hard surface, it
is well to add, refrain from doing so yourself. On the
elastic turf these paces do comparatively little harm;
but for the road, and indeed all ordinary usage, except
hunting or racing, the trot or walk is the proper pace.
My impression coincides with that of many experienced
sportsmen, that one mile of a canter on a hard surface<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
does more injury to the frame and legs of a horse, than
twenty miles’ walk and trot: for this reason, that in
the act of walking or trotting the off fore and near hind
feet are on the ground at the same moment alternately
with the other two, thus dividing the pressure of weight
and propulsion on the legs more than even ambling,
which is a lateral motion; while in anything approaching
to the canter or gallop, the two fore feet and legs
have at the same moment to bear the entire weight of
man and horse, as well as the jar of the act of propulsion
from behind.</p>

<p><i>Ambling</i> is a favourite pace with the Americans,
whose horses are trained to it; also with the Easterns.
It is, as before mentioned, a lateral motion, much less
injurious to the wear and tear of the legs than either
canter or gallop on the hard road, the off fore and hind
being on the ground alternately with the near fore and
hind legs.</p>

<p>Though unsightly to an Englishman’s eyes, this pace
is decidedly the easiest of all to the rider, and may be
accelerated from four to six or eight miles an hour without
the least inconvenience. Some American horses are
taught to excel in this pace, so as to beat regular trotters.</p>

<p>By trotting a horse you do him comparatively little
injury on the road; but observe the animal that has
been constantly ridden by ladies (at watering-places and
elsewhere), who are so fond of the canter: he stands
over, and is decidedly shaky on his legs, although the
weight on his back has been generally light. Observe,
on the contrary, the bearer of the experienced horseman;
although the weight he had to carry may have
been probably what is called “a welter,” <i>his legs are
right enough</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>The softness of the turf, as fitting it for the indulgence
of a gallop, is indicated by the depth of the
horse-tracks; there is not much impression left on a
hard road.</p>

<p>It should be always borne in mind that “it is <i>the pace
that kills</i>,” and unless the wear and tear of horse-flesh
be a matter of no consideration, according as the pace
is increased from that of five or six miles per hour, so
should the distance for the animal’s day’s work be
diminished.</p>

<p>For instance, if you require him to do seven miles in
the hour <i>daily</i>, that seven miles must always be considered
as full work for the day; if you purpose going
eight miles per hour, your horse should only travel six
miles daily at that rate; if faster still, five miles only
should be your bearer’s limit; if at a ten-mile rate,
then four miles; or at a twelve-mile rate, three miles
per day. But of course such regulations apply to <i>daily</i>
work only, as a horse is capable of accomplishing a great
deal more without injury, if only called upon to do so
occasionally.</p>

<p>A man may require to do a day’s journey of thirty
miles, or a day’s hunting, and such work being only
occasional, no harm whatever to the animal need result;
but about eight or ten miles a-day at an alternate walk
or trot (say six-miles-an-hour pace) is as much as any
valuable animal ought to do if worked regularly.</p>

<p>No horse ought to be hunted more than twice a-week
<i>at the utmost</i>.</p>

<p>The work of horses, especially when ridden, ought to
be so managed that the latter part of the journey may
be done in a walk, so that they may be brought in
cool.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>A horse in the saddle is capable of travelling a hundred
miles, or even more, in twenty-four hours, if required;
and if the weight be light, and the rider judicious,
such feats <i>may</i> be done occasionally without
injury: but if a journey of a hundred miles be contemplated,
it is better to take three days for its performance,
each day’s journey of over thirty miles being
divided into two equal portions, and got through early
in the morning and late in the afternoon; the pace an
alternate walk and trot at the rate of about five miles
an hour, to vary it, as continuous walking for so long
as a couple of hours when travelling on the road, may
prove so tiresome that horses would require watching to
keep them on their legs; and it is good for both horse
and man that the latter should dismount and take the
whole, or nearly the whole, of the walking part on his
own feet, thus not only relieving his bearer from the
continual pressure of the rider’s weight on the saddle on
his back, but as a man when riding and walking brings
into play two completely distinct sets of muscles, he
will, though a little tired from walking, find himself on
remounting positively refreshed from that change of
exercise.</p>

<p>This recommendation is equally applicable to the
hunting-field at any check, or when there is the least
opportunity. So well is the truth of the above remark
known to the most experienced horsemen, that some
of them, steeplechase riders, make it a practice before
riding a severe race to walk rapidly from five to ten
miles to the course, in preference to making use of any
of the many vehicles always at their disposal on such
occasions.</p>

<p>It is only surprising that the expediency of making<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
dragoons dismount and walk beside their horses on a
march, at least part of the way, for distances of one or
two miles at a time, is not more apparent to those in
authority (many of them practical men), in whose power
it lies to make a regulation so very salutary for both
man and horse. The more the beneficial effect of such
an arrangement is considered, the more desirable it
would appear to be, especially in dry weather. The
great occasional relief to an overweighted horse of
being divested of his rider now and then, would rather
serve than injure the latter, on account of the variety
of exercise, as before remarked, while his handling of
the horse would decidedly be enlivened by the change.</p>

<p><i>Signals of Distress</i> on increased pace.—Prominently
may be mentioned a horse becoming winded, or, as
sportsmen call it, having “bellows to mend,” which in
proper hands ought seldom to occur, even in the hunting-field,
as there are tokens which precede it—such
as the creature hanging on his work, poking his head
backwards and forwards, describing a sort of semicircle
with his nose, gaping, the ears lopping, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Some horsemen are in the habit of giving ale or
porter (from a pint to a quart of either) to their horses
during severe work. This is not at all a bad plan, if
the beast will take it; and as many masters are fond
of petting their animals with biscuit or bread, a piece
of either being occasionally soaked in one of the above
liquids when given, will accustom the creature so trained
to the taste of them.</p>

<p>After the work is over a little well-made gruel is a
great restorative; and when a long journey is completed,
a bran-mash might be given, as mentioned under
the head of “Feeding,” <a href="#Page_22">page 22</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>One of the worst results to be dreaded from a horse
going long journeys daily, is fever in the feet (<a href="#Page_132">page
132</a>), which may be obviated by stopping the fore feet
directly they are picked and washed out at the end of
each day’s journey.—<a href="#Page_13"><i>See</i> page 13.</a></p>

<p>After a long journey, it would be desirable to have
the animal’s fore shoes <i>at least</i> removed.</p>

<p>The saddle ought not to be taken off for some time
after work; the longer it has been under the rider, and
the more severe the work, the longer, comparatively,
it should remain on after use, in order to avoid that
frightful result which is most like to ensue from its
being quickly removed—viz., sore back. With cavalry,
saddles are left on for an hour or more after the return
from a field-day or march.</p>

<p>A numna or absorbing sweat-cloth under the saddle
is in cases of hard or continued work a great preservative
against sore back.</p>

<p>When an extraordinary day’s work has been done,
after the horse is cleaned and fed he should be at once
bedded down, and left to rest in quiet, interrupted only
to be fed.</p>

<h3>BRIDLING.</h3>

<p>Every horseman before he mounts should observe
closely whether his horse is properly saddled and
bridled.</p>

<p>Bits must be invariably of wrought steel, and the
mouthpiece <i>in all bits</i> should fit the horse’s mouth
<i>exactly</i> in its width: the bit that is made to fit a sixteen-hands-high
is surely too large for a fourteen-hand
cob. The bit ought to lie just above the tusk in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
horse’s jaw, and one inch above the last teeth with a
mare.</p>

<p>It must be adapted to the mouth and temper of the
horse as well as to the formation of his head and neck.
A riding-master, or the rider, if he has any judgment,
ought to be able to form an opinion as to the most
suitable bit for an animal.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The ordinary <i>Bridoon</i> (or Double bridle, as it is called
in the North) is best adapted to the well-mouthed and
tempered horse, and is the safest and best bridle for
either road or field. Unfinished gentlemen as well as
lady equestrians, when riding with double reins to the
bits, are recommended to tie the curb-bit rein evenly in
a knot on the horse’s neck (holding only the bridoon-rein
in the hand), provided his temper and mouth be
suitable to a snaffle. This is a practice pursued by some
even good and experienced horsemen where the temper
of a horse is high, in order to have the curb-bit to rely
upon in case he should happen to pull too hard on the
bridoon or snaffle, which otherwise would be quite sufficient
and best to use alone.</p>

<p>The <i>Curb-chain</i>, when used, should be strong and
tight; it should invariably be supported by a lip-strap,
an adjunct that is really most essential, but which
grooms practically ignore by losing. The object of the
lip-strap is to prevent the curb, if rather loose, from falling
over the lip, thus permitting the horse to get hold of
it in his mouth and go where he pleases; it also guards
against a trick some beasts are very clever at, of catching
the cheek or leg of the bit in their teeth, and making<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
off in spite of the efforts of any rider. If the curb
be tight, the lip-strap is equally useful in keeping it
horizontally, and preventing its drooping to too great
a pressure, thus causing abrasion of the animal’s jaw.
The curb <i>ought</i> to be pretty tight, sufficiently so to
admit one finger between it and the jaw-bone.</p>

<p>The <i>Snaffle</i> with a fine-mouthed horse is well adapted
for the field—the only place where I would ever dispense
altogether with the curb-bit, and then only in
favour of a fine-mouthed well-tempered beast disposed
to go coolly at his fences.</p>

<p>On the road a horse may put his foot upon a stone
in a jog-trot, or come upon some irregularity; and unless
the rider has something more than a snaffle in his hand,
he is exceedingly likely to suffer for it. Many a horse
that is like a foot-ball in the field, full of life and elasticity,
and never making a mistake, will on the road
require constant watching to prevent his tumbling on
his nose.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>At the same time, a horse should by no means be
encouraged to lean on the bit or on the rider’s support,
which most of them will be found quite ready to do; a
disposition in that direction must be checked by mildly
feeling his mouth (with the bit), pressing your legs
against his sides, and enlivening him gently with the
whip or spur.</p>

<p>The <i>Martingal</i>.—The standing or head martingal is
a handsome equipment—safe and serviceable with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
beast that is incorrigible about getting his head up, but
should be used in the street or on the road only.</p>

<p>The <i>Ring-Martingal</i> is intended solely for the field
with a horse whose head cannot be kept down; but it
requires to be used with nice judgment, and handling
of the second or separate rein, which should pass through
it, especially when the animal is in or near the act of
taking his fences, when, with some horses, comparative
freedom may be allowed to the head, which should,
however, be brought down to its proper place directly
he is safely landed on his legs again by the use of this
second martingal-rein, which is attached to the bridoon
bit.</p>

<p><i>N.B.</i>—If this second rein be attached to the snaffle
by buckles (and not stitched on as it ought to be), the
buckles of the rein should be defended from getting
into the rings of the martingal by pieces of leather
larger than those rings. Most serious accidents have
occurred from the absence of this precaution: the buckle
becoming caught in the ring, the horse’s head is fixed
in one position, and not knowing where he is going, he
proceeds, probably without any control from the rider,
till both come to some serious mishap. The rein
stitched to the ring of the bit is the safest.</p>

<p>The <i>Running-Rein</i>, or other plan of martingal (from
the D in front of the saddle above the rider’s knee
through the ring of the snaffle to his hand), should only
be used by the riding-master or those competent to
avail themselves of its assistance in forming the mouth
of a troublesome or untrained animal. Some experienced
horsemen, however, when they find they cannot
keep the nose in or head down with ordinary bits, instead
of using a martingal of any denomination, employ<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
(especially in the field) with good effect a ring, keeping
the <i>bridoon</i> or snaffle-reins under the bend of the neck;
or a better contrivance is a bit of stiff leather three or
four inches long, with two D’s or staples for the reins
to pass through on each side.</p>

<p>The <i>Chifney Bit</i> is the most suitable for ladies’ use,
or for timid or invalid riders: it at once brings up a
hard-pulling horse, but requires very gentle handling.
I have known more than one horse to be quite unmanageable
in any but a Chifney bit.</p>

<p>The more severe bits are those that have the longest
legs or cheeks, giving the greatest leverage against the
curb. By the addition of deep ports on the mouthpiece
of the bit much severity is attained (especially
when the port is constructed turned downwards, in place
of the usual practice of making it upwards), which can
be increased to the utmost by the addition of a tight
noseband to prevent the horse from easing the port by
movement of his tongue or jaws.</p>

<p>It is almost needless to observe, that the reverse of
the above will be the mildest bits for tender-mouthed,
easy-going horses.</p>

<p><i>Twisted Mouthpieces</i> are happily now almost out of
fashion, and ought to be entirely discountenanced;
their original intention was to command hard-mouthed
horses, whose mouths their use can only render
harder.</p>

<p>The <i>Noseband</i>, if tightened, would be found very
useful with many a hard-pulling horse in the excitement
of hunting, when the bit, which would otherwise require
to be used, would only irritate the puller, cause him
to go more wildly, and make matters worse. I have
known some pullers to be more under control in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
hunting-field with a pretty tight noseband and a snaffle
than with the most severe curb-bit.</p>

<p>The <i>Throat-lash</i> is almost always too tight. Grooms
are much in the habit of making this mistake, by
means of which, when the head is bent by a severe
bit, the throat is compressed and the respiration impeded,
besides occasioning an ugly appearance in the
caparison.</p>

<p>It may be remarked also that, if not corrected, servants
are apt to leave the ends of the bridle head-stall
straps dangling at length out of the loops, which is very
unsightly: the ends of the straps should be inserted in
these loops, which should be sufficiently tight to retain
them.</p>

<h3>SADDLING.</h3>

<p>A <i>Saddle</i> should be made to fit the horse for which
it is intended, and requires as much variation in shape,
especially in the stuffing, as there is variety in the
shapes of horses’ backs.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> An animal may be fairly
shaped in the back, and yet a saddle that fits another
horse will always go out on this one’s withers. The
saddle having been made to fit your horse, let it be
placed gently upon him, and shifted till its proper
berth be found. When in its right place, the action of
the upper part of the shoulder-blade should be quite
free from any confinement or pressure by what saddlers
call the “gullet” of the saddle under the pommel when
the animal is in motion. It stands to reason that any
interference with the action of the shoulder-blade must,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
after a time, indirectly if not directly, cause a horse to
falter in his movement.</p>

<p><i>N.B.</i>—A horse left in the stable with his saddle on,
with or without a bridle, ought always to have his head
fastened up, to prevent his lying down on the saddle
and injuring it.</p>

<p><i>Girths.</i>—When girthing a horse, which is always
done upon the near or left-hand side, the girth should
be first drawn tightly towards you under the belly of
the horse, so as to bring the saddle <i>rather</i> to the off side
on the back of the beast. This is seldom done by
grooms; and though a gentleman is not supposed to
girth his horse, information on this as well as on other
points may happen to be of essential service to him;
for the consequence of the attendant’s usual method is,
that when the girths are tightened up, the saddle, instead
of being in the centre of the horse’s back, is inclined
to the near or left-hand side, to which it is still
farther drawn by the act of mounting, so that when a
man has mounted he fancies that one stirrup is longer
than the other—the near-side stirrup invariably the
longest. To remedy this he forces down his foot in the
right stirrup, which brings the saddle to the centre of
the animal’s back.</p>

<p>All this would be obviated by care being taken, in
the process of girthing, to place the left hand on the
middle of the saddle, drawing the first or under girth
with the right hand till the girth-holder reaches the
buckle, the left hand being then disengaged to assist
in bracing up the girth. The outer girth must go
through the same process, being drawn under the belly
of the horse from the off side tightly before it is attached
to the girth-holder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>With ladies’ saddles most particular attention should
be paid to the girthing.</p>

<div class="blockquote smaller">

<p class="hanging">(It must be observed that, with some horses having the knack
of swelling themselves out during the process of girthing,
the girths may be tightened before leaving the stable so as to
appear almost too tight, but which, when the horse has been
walked about for ten minutes, will seem comparatively loose,
and quite so when the rider’s weight is placed in the saddle.)</p>

</div>

<p><i>Stirrup-Irons</i> should invariably be of wrought steel.
A man should never be induced knowingly to ride in a
cast-metal stirrup, any more than he ought to attempt
to do so with a cast-metal bit.</p>

<p>Stirrup-irons should be selected to suit the size of
the rider’s foot; those with two or three narrow bars
at the bottom are decidedly preferable, for the simple
reason, that in cold weather it is a tax on a man’s endurance
to have a single broad bar like an icicle in the
ball of his foot, and in wet weather a similar argument
may apply as regards damp; besides, with the double
bar, the foot has a better hold in the stirrup, the rings
being, of course, indented (rasp-like), as they usually
are, to prevent the foot from slipping in them.</p>

<p>This description of stirrup, with an instep-pad, is
preferable for ladies to the slipper, which is decidedly
obsolete.</p>

<p>Latchford’s<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> ladies’ patent safety stirrup seems to
combine every precaution for the security of fair equestrians.</p>

<p>A balance-strap to a side-saddle is very desirable, and
in general use.</p>

<p>Where expense is no object, stirrups that open at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
side with a spring are, no doubt, the safest for gentlemen
in case of any accident.</p>

<p>With regard to <i>Stirrup-Leathers</i>, saddlers generally
turn the right or dressed side out for appearance; but
as the dressing causes a tightness on that side of the
leather, the undressed side, which admits of more expansion,
should be outside—because, after a little wear,
the leather is susceptible of cracks, and the already extended
side will crack the soonest. The leather will
break in the most insidious place, either in the D
under the stirrup-iron, where no one but the servant
who cleans it can see it; or else, perhaps, where the
buckle wears it under the flap of the saddle. Stirrup-leathers
broken in this manner have caused many
accidents.</p>

<p>Invariably adjust your stirrup-leathers <i>before mounting</i>.</p>

<p>To measure the length of the stirrup-leathers of a
new saddle, place the fingers of the right hand against
the bar to which the leathers are attached, and, measuring
from the bottom bar of the stirrup up to the
armpit, make the length of the leathers and stirrups
equal to the length of your arm, from the tips of the
fingers to the armpit. Before entering the field, in
hunting or crossing country, draw up the leathers two
or three holes shorter on each side; and when starting
on a long journey it is as well to do the same, to ease
both yourself and your bearer.</p>

<p><i>Clumped-soled Boots</i> occasion accidents. If, in case
of yourself or your horse falling, the foot catch in
the stirrup, a boot with such a sole may prevent its
release.</p>

<p>The <i>Crupper</i>, though now obsolete for saddles, except<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
in military caparison, would be decidedly beneficial
in keeping the saddle in its proper place <i>on long journeys</i>,
especially where, from the shape of the animal,
the saddle <i>will</i> come too much forward, interfering with
the action of the shoulders, and throwing the weight of
the burden unduly on the fore-quarters, thus increasing
the odds in favour of a tired beast making an irretrievable
stumble.</p>

<p>The dock of the crupper should be seen to that it is
soft, and free from crusted sweat and dandriff, which
would naturally cause irritation and abrasion of the tail.
It should be always kept well greased ready for use.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Military Crupper</i>, according to the rules of the
service, should be so loose between cantel and dock
as to admit of a man’s hand being turned with ease
between the horse’s back and the strap. If the crupper
be intended merely for ornament, such a regulation has
hardly any meaning, for it cannot be considered ornamental
to see an apparently useless piece of leather
dangling at one side over a horse’s hip; and if the intention
be to make it useful, to keep the saddle from
going too far forward on ill-formed horses,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> or in case of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
strong exertion, it is obvious that a loose strap (according
to orders) could hardly serve any such purpose. If
the crupper be for use, it would appear that after the
saddle is placed in its proper position on the animal’s
back (the crupper being left at its full length for this
purpose), and previous to girthing, it should be shortened
so as to <i>retain</i> the saddle in that place under any
circumstances,—not, however, that the crupper should
be so tightened as to inconvenience the beast, and half
cut his tail off; it will be tight enough to serve its
purpose if <i>one</i> or <i>two</i> fingers can be easily turned under
the strap.</p>

<p>The <i>Breastplate</i> may be necessary in hunting or
steeplechasing with horses that are light behind the
girth, or what is vulgarly called “herring-gutted,” and
is used to prevent the saddle from getting too far back,
or, as the grooms say, the horse “running through
his girths.” Animals trained to such trying work as
steeplechasing, or even hunting, will become much
smaller in the carcass than a trooper or an ordinary
gentleman’s hack.</p>

<p>With dragoons this part of the equipment is generally
ill-adjusted, as if to correspond with the inefficient
arrangement of the crupper, the breast-straps being
often <i>too tight</i>. Frequently, during manœuvring in
the field or the riding-school, I have seen breast-straps
burst in consequence of their tightness; and indeed it
stands to reason they can thus but interfere with a
horse’s action in leaping or making more than ordinary
exertion. Their tightness not only renders discomfiture
imminent, but must drag the saddle forward out of its
place.</p>

<p>Altogether it might be desirable that commanding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
officers of some cavalry regiments would study the pose
on horseback of Marochetti’s sculptured dragoons, or
those of other eminent artists. The result would probably
be a marked improvement in the position of the
saddle, and, consequently, in the general <i>coup d’œil</i> of
our cavalry, who, however, notwithstanding such minor
defects, have always maintained their superiority in
horsemanship, as well as in efficiency, over any other
cavalry in the world.</p>

<h3>RIDING.</h3>

<p>The seat, method of holding the hands, &amp;c., should
be left to the riding-master,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> with a friendly admonition
to the learner to avoid the “stuck-up,” one-handed
principle to a great extent, and to take a lesson whenever
opportunity occurs from one of the “great untaught,”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
and, observing their ease and judgment in
the management of their bearers, endeavour to modify
their own horsemanship accordingly.</p>

<p>Kindness goes far in managing these noble animals.</p>

<p>How is it that many horses that are unmanageable
with powerful and good horsemen, can be ridden with
perfect ease and safety by ladies? The first thing a
lady generally does after mounting, is to reassure her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
steed by patting, or, in riding-school language, “making
much of him,” taking up the reins with a very
light hand, and giving him his head; whereas a man
usually does the very reverse; he takes a commanding
hold of the reins, presses his legs into the horse as the
signal for motion, perhaps with a rasp of both spurs
into his sides, indicating no great amiability of temper—a
state of things very likely to be reciprocated by a
high-spirited horse.</p>

<p>As before observed, every man ought himself to be
able to judge whether his horse is properly saddled and
bridled. I must still inveigh against misplacement of
the saddle, which grooms, it will be remarked, usually
place too far forward—a mistake which is of more consequence
than is generally considered.</p>

<p>Take a dragoon, for instance, weighing, with arms,
accoutrements, and kit, from fifteen to twenty stone;
this weight, if allowed to fall unduly on the fore
quarter, must help to founder the charger, and bring
him into trouble on the first provocation. Let him
make the least stumble, and the weight of his burden,
instead of being back in its proper place, with the
man’s assistance there to help him up, is thrown forward,
keeping the beast tied down, and preventing his
rising. But, taking appearances into consideration,
the forward placement of the saddle is most ungraceful,
reminding one of the position of an Eastern driving an
elephant, seated on his bearer’s neck.</p>

<p>I have seen the <i>tout ensemble</i> of a magnificent cavalry
regiment strikingly deteriorated by the ungraceful and
absolutely unhorsemanlike misplacement of the saddles,
and consequently of the men—though the military
regulation on the subject is fair enough, directing a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
saddle to be placed a handbreadth behind the play of
the shoulder. This would, perhaps, be a slight excess
in the other direction, were it not considered that, in
all probability, out of a hundred troop-horses so saddled,
ninety-nine would be found after an hour’s trotting
to have shifted the saddle <i>forward</i>, for one on
whom it would have remained stationary or gone back.</p>

<p>It is well known that no rider should ever go fast
down-hill on the road, or round a corner, especially on
pavement; but in the field, hunting or racing, down-hill
is the place to make play.</p>

<p>In the absence of an attendant to hold for mounting,
some horses are allowed to contract a habit that is liable
to cause accidents, of starting before the rider is comfortably
seated in the saddle. Prevent this bad fashion
by gathering the snaffle-rein (not the curb) tightly up
before mounting, and when across the saddle, and before
the right leg is in the stirrup, check any effort to
move off.</p>

<p>When a horse is alarmed, nothing so effectually reassures
him as speaking to him. I have myself experienced
the efficacy of gently using my voice on two or
three occasions, when I admit having been run away
with for a short time.</p>

<p>Though a horse ought never to be allowed to have his
own way, his rider should try every means before resorting
to actual punishment or fight, which may be sometimes
unavoidable as the only chance of conquest.</p>

<p>An animal requiring such treatment should be handed
over to the rough-rider for subsequent teaching, if not
disposed of for more suitable employment than that of
a gentleman’s horse.</p>

<p>Your bearer should not be allowed to keep a perpetual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
lean upon your hand, more particularly when walking.
Should he stumble while thus leaning, he is not likely
to recover himself, but will fall helplessly on his knees.</p>

<p>Keep him as self-dependent as possible, though not
with a rein so slack as to leave him to himself altogether.
It is the business or amusement of the rider
to be on the alert for all casualties.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>To make a horse change his foot in canter, if you
find it difficult to do so by merely using hand and leg,
turn him <i>as if</i> to circle towards that side that you require
the foot to lead—he will use the foot forward that
you wish in order to prop himself in turning. Thus, if
you circle round to the right, he will lead with the off
fore foot; and if you turn to the left, the near fore will
be advanced.</p>

<p>In using a curb, the rider should remember that if
it is properly placed, with a fair leverage, rough-handling
of the lower or bit rein may drive a fine-tempered
animal into a state of great irritation, or even prove an
incentive to rearing;<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and directly anything like this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
effect seems to be produced, that rein should be eased,
and the bridoon-rein borne up.</p>

<p class="caption">RIDING AT IT</p>
</div>

<p>In fencing, the snaffle or bridoon bit and rein <i>only</i>
ought to be used; <i>this the rider should particularly bear
in mind</i>. A rider with a hold of the curb-rein in fencing,
getting the least out of his equilibrium, or giving
an involuntary check to the curb, may put any well-mouthed
animal entirely out of his own way, preventing
his jumping safely and confidently, and probably causing
accidents. One of several reasons why the Irish
horses excel in fencing is, that it is very much the custom
in that country to use snaffles in cross-country riding.
The curb-rein may be taken up, if necessary, after
the jump is over. (Some horses, however, are such violent
pullers, that, in the full tilt of going to hounds, where
the country is close and fencing frequent, it is almost
impossible to avoid using the curb-rein occasionally in
the act of jumping.)</p>

<p>While touching on cross-country riding, it may be
observed that many men who ought to know better,
often make a serious mistake in not leaving hunters
more to themselves than they do when going at and
taking their fences. Horses vary in their mode of progression;
and whether the gait be slow or fast, anything
of a trained animal, when interfered with under
these circumstances, will be put out of his own way
(which is generally best suited to his peculiar temper
or ability), in placing his legs advantageously to make
his jump with safety.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>Let your horse, if he is anything of a fencer, choose
his own way and pace to take his jumps.</p>

<p>In riding to hounds, if practicable, it is well to avoid
newly made or repaired ditches or fences; your steed
is apt to encounter such with diffidence; he does not
take the jump with the same will, fears there’s “something
up,” and from want of confidence may very possibly
make a mistake.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>It would be well, for cross-country horsemen more especially,
to bear in mind Sir Francis Head’s observation, as applied to riders
as well as horses, that “the belly lifts the legs;” meaning, I take
it, that if man or horse is out of tone from derangement of the
stomach or general debility, he cannot be up to the mark or fit
for any physical exertion. It is well known to steeplechase riders
and men who ride straight to hounds, that occasionally, in consequence
of inertion, indulgence, or dissipation, having deranged the
stomach or nervous system, a rider will be done up before his
steed, who, oppressed with a comparatively dead weight knocking
about on his back, will himself follow suit from want of being held
together, and probably come a burster at some jump before the
finish.</p>

</div>

<p>To a practical horseman the act of standing in the
stirrups will suggest itself as a matter of expediency to
ease himself, when the horse is pulling hard at or near
his full galloping pace.</p>

<p>The great advantage of a rider easing his bearer by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
walking up-hill is treated of under the head of “Work,”
<a href="#Page_36">page 36</a>.</p>

<p>When a rider finds his horse going tender or lame,
he ought <i>immediately</i> to dismount and examine his
feet. If a stone has become bedded between the clefts
of the frog, or got between shoe and sole, and a picker
does not happen to be at hand, a suitable stone should
be sought wherewith to dislodge the one in the foot.
If no stone in the foot can be discovered as causing
the lameness, closer examination must be made in
search of a nail, a piece of iron or rough glass, or other
damage to the sole. If no apparent means of relief
present itself, the sooner the beast is led to the nearest
place where a proper examination of the foot can
take place the better.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> For the amount of work a
horse can do, see remarks on that subject, under the
head of “Work,” <a href="#Page_35">page 35</a>; and to avoid broken knees,
see hints on that subject, <a href="#Page_51">pages 51</a> and <a href="#Page_141">141</a>.</p>

<p><i>Mounting of Lady in Side-Saddle.</i>—The mounter,
being as close as possible to the animal, should place
his right hand on his right knee, and in it receive the
lady’s left foot. When she springs she should straighten
her left knee, at the same time having in her right
hand the reins, with a fast hold of the middle crutch,
and her left hand on the mounter’s shoulder to help
her to spring up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<h3>HARNESSING.</h3>

<p><i>The General Mounting</i>, whether of brass or silver-plated
(to correspond with the mountings of the
carriage), or with leather-covered buckles, is all a
matter of taste; the leather being, however, the least
durable.</p>

<p><i>A Dry Harness-Room</i> is indispensable, in which
there should be shallow presses with pegs, but no
shelves; otherwise, coverings should be provided for
harness and saddles to preserve them from flying dust.</p>

<p><i>Style.</i>—In pairing horses for draught, if one be
rather larger than the other, the larger should be
placed on the near or left side, as the left-hand side of
the road being that on which vehicles travel, the near-side
horse will generally be going an inch or more lower
than the off-side one, and the difference of size in the
pair will be less perceptible.</p>

<p>If the animals are of an even size, and one be more
lazy than the other, that one should be placed at the
off side, being thus more conveniently situated to receive
gentle reminders from the whip without observation.
If one of the pair <i>will</i> carry his head higher
than the other, <i>his</i> coupling-rein<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> should run under
that of the animal that leans his head the most, so as
to bring their heads as much on a level as possible. An
ivory ring, to run the coupling-reins through, looks and
acts well.</p>

<p>Both manes should be trained to flow either in or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
out from the pole; the latter way is probably preferable.</p>

<p>Horses left to <i>stand harnessed</i> in the stable should
be turned round in the stalls and fastened with the
T’s of two pillar-reins passed through the rings of the
bridoon of bit. Should there be no pillar-reins in
pairs belonging to the stern-posts of each stall, tie the
horses’ heads up with the rack-rein, so as to prevent
their lying down in the harness.</p>

<p>As a maxim, never leave a bridle on in the stable,
unless in the case where the head can be sustained by
a pair of pillar-reins from the stern-posts. Most serious
accidents have occurred through neglect of this
rule.</p>

<p>In <i>Yoking</i> or “<i>putting to</i>,” the shafts of a vehicle
must never be left on the ground while the horse is
being backed into them. If the shafts touch him he
will probably kick, or he may injure by standing on
them. In double harness, especially with spirited
animals, to prevent the danger of their backing, and
being induced to kick by coming in contact with the
splinter-bar when putting to, first confine them to the
point of the pole by the pole chains or leathers, so
lengthened as to enable the traces to be attached (the
outer ones first) to the carriage; which done, tighten
the chains or leathers to their working length. Accidents
may thus be averted. From the moment horses
are “put to” their draught, until they are driven off,
some one should stand before their heads, whether they
be in single, pair, or four-horse harness.</p>

<p><i>Traces.</i>—Great care should be taken in adjusting
these to prove that they are of an even length, as the
least deviation in equality is liable, by pressure on one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
side, to produce a sore on the neck, under the collar of
the horse that happens to be on the side of the shortest
trace.—<a href="#Page_87"><i>See</i> “Jibbing,” page 87.</a></p>

<p>The buckles of all traces and back-bands ought to be
provided with detached pieces of leather cut square the
width of those straps, and placed under the buckles the
tongues of which pass through these bits of leather; the
straps, thus protected from being cut by the buckles,
will wear nearly thrice as long as otherwise, and there
is nothing unsightly in the arrangement.</p>

<p>In all cases draught-horses should be placed close to
their work—<i>i.e.</i>, the traces should meet as short as will
just allow of the animals going down an inclination at
a brisk pace without coming in contact with the carriage;
the britching for single, and the pole-chains for
double harness, being tightened in proportion, to keep
the carriage from running on them down-hill.</p>

<p>For <i>Pole-Chains</i> and <i>Swinging-Bars</i>, see <a href="#Page_73">page 73</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>Hames</i>.—In order to divide the draught or
pressure of the traces on the shoulders a little, the
hames might be furnished with scroll draught eyes;
this, however, has become unfashionable from being
much used by cabmen, and for rough draught.</p>

<p><i>Hames Top-Straps.</i>—Care should be taken that
these are perfectly sound and strong, especially in
<i>double</i> harness, where the strain of stopping and backing
the carriage of necessity comes upon them.</p>

<p><i>Britching</i> and <i>Kicking-Strap</i>.—It is better in single
harness to have the britching made with side-straps
attached to the buckle or tug of the <i>back-band</i>, and
not to pass over the shaft (confined there by a loop or
staple as is usual). These side-straps can be tightened
or loosened according to the size of the animal, and if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
properly adjusted, effectually prevent any carriage from
running on the quarters. Across the horses’ hips and
through these straps, confined by square metal D’s,
passes the kicking-strap, which is attached to the tugs
on the shafts by buckles. This caparison, instead of
being unsightly, is positively more elegant than the
ordinary-shaped britching, and provides a kicking-strap
at all times with the britching.</p>

<p>The kicking-strap for double harness must always be
inelegant, nor can it be made as effectual as that for
single harness; for which reason, if for no other, a kicking
horse should never be used in double harness under
a gentleman’s carriage.</p>

<p>Britching is not generally used for double harness;
but where appearances are not regarded, it finds place
amongst various other contrivances available to make
kickers, jibbers, bolters, plungers, and runaways, work
as placidly as if “they couldn’t help it.”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Terret-Pad</i> must be left to the taste of the
owner and saddler, with an observation, that in single
harness it should be ascertained that the back-band
has always free play through it; and as a precaution, it
is desirable that in single harness the belly-band be always
wrapped once round at least one of the shafts before
the tug, whether the draught be on four or on a pair
of wheels. Neglect in this particular has often occasioned
accidents. The terret-pad is generally placed too
far forward; the shortening of the crupper remedies this.</p>

<p>In double harness have a care that the terret-pad trace
bearing-straps are not buckled too short. I have seen
fine tall horses greatly worn by these straps being too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
tight, tying the animals across the back, the undue
pressure being aggravated with each elevation of the
frame in the act of progression.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="fig1">
<img src="images/fig1.jpg" width="400" height="325" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span>—Front View of
a Collar, with the stuffing
placed as it should be for
wear with ease and safety.
<i>a a</i>, rim of collar all round.
<i>b b</i>, stuffing projecting
round outside of rim.
<i>c c</i>, stuffing to project inside
at back of rim, for
the purpose of tightening
the collar on the
neck in that situation,
and thus obviate abrasion.</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Collar.</i>—More care and judgment are necessary
in shaping the stuffing of the collar to fit a horse than
for any other part of the harness. The collar should
not press either on the mane or on the under part of
the neck round the gullet; the pressure should be on
each side of the neck at <i>c c</i> in figure. Collars to fit the
ordinary run of horses ought to be shaped thus, by the
padding exclusive of the rim. The shape of the rim is
comparatively immaterial, but it must be strong to retain
the collar in shape. Any collar, be it ever so well
shaped, should be tried on the horse’s neck before it
is taken into wear, to make sure that it is neither too
large nor too small.</p>

<p>Some horses’ heads are large in proportion with the
size of collar they require; in such cases, out of compassion
for the poor animal over whose head the small
collar has to be forced at the risk of injuring his eyes,
the collar, which is generally closed, should be made
open at the top, to fasten with buckle and strap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p>Under ordinary circumstances the open collars are not
preferable, as the opening and closing weakens the rim,
and is likely to put them out of shape; but as grooms
have a fashion of putting the collar on with the rigid
hames tightly buckled round it, the whole process of
forcing a small closed collar over a beast’s larger head
is so repulsive to him that in time he learns to dread
the very sight of a collar. The plan of putting on the
collar with the hames attached to it should never be
permitted.</p>

<p><i>Saving-Collar</i>, and description of make.—This is
generally formed by harness-makers of basil with
quilted padding. More serviceable than this will be
found the saving-collar cut of single leather, from the
soft or belly part of the cow-hide. A breast-strap is
placed at the bottom of the collar with a loop and
buckle at the end, through which the belly-band of the
terret-pad passes to confine the collar.</p>

<p>Every owner of harness should be provided with one
or two saving-collars of this description to be used
where severe work is expected, on long journeys, or
with animals new to harness. They should be open at
the top, to fasten there with two buckles and narrow
straps, the tightening or lengthening of the latter enabling
it to be fitted to the horse’s size. Some care is
necessary to observe that the regular collar does not
rub the buckles of the saving-collar against the horse’s
neck and make a sore.</p>

<p>The saving-collar should be always kept well moistened
with grease or oil, and carefully looked to after
use, the crusted sweat and dandriff being scraped off it.
In the absence of a saving-collar, the collar itself should
be watched in the same respect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>The bridles generally in use for harness appear to
require little or no improvement.</p>

<p>The <i>Bit</i> must be equally adapted to the horse’s
mouth, &amp;c., as for riding (<a href="#Page_38">page 38</a>), except that with
harness, while to all appearance using the same kind of
bit with a pair of horses, the leverage on the mouths
can be altered, by placing the billets or buckle-end of
the driving-reins high or low in the cheeks of each,
according to the animal’s temper, his bearing on it,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>In placing the billets in the bit, it should be borne
in mind that the more use is made of the curb the more
will be taken out of the horse; therefore, when a long
journey or severe work has to be done, animals should
be driven in snaffle, or the billets should be placed as
near as possible to the mouthpiece of the bit.</p>

<p>Experience only can demonstrate the difference in the
wear and tear of the general physique, resulting from
a judicious arrangement or otherwise of the reins and
bit.</p>

<p><i>Blinkers.</i>—The question of “blinkers or no blinkers”
can best be answered by the observation, that if you
can find horses that may be depended upon to work
safely and steadily without them, they may be dispensed
with; but as such animals are rare, blinkers are
likely to continue in general use.</p>

<p>Placing crests or ornaments on blinkers, unless the
latter are light and well hollowed, and kept extended
in front by stiff blinker-straps, is a practice likely to
be injurious to the animals’ eyes; in fact, all blinkers,
unless light and well hollowed, are dangerous for the
eyes, and of course the increased weight of crests and
their fastenings aggravates the objection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>Heavy forehead-bands and rosettes, though ornamental,
are anything but desirable, as far as the horse
himself is concerned.</p>

<p>The <i>Noseband</i> of the harness bridle, like the riding
one, can by tightening be made very useful with some
descriptions of hard-pulling horses.—<a href="#Page_42"><i>See</i> “Noseband,”
page 42.</a></p>

<p>The <i>Breastplate</i>, or head-stall martingal, can be made
useful in the same way.—<a href="#Page_40"><i>See</i> page 40.</a></p>

<p><i>Throat-lash.</i>—<a href="#Page_43"><i>See</i> page 43.</a></p>

<p><i>Reins.</i>—Saddlers generally suit the reins admirably
to the work for which they are intended. A buff
hand-piece with pullers is decidedly preferable to plain
leather, as its roughness enables the driver to have a
much firmer hold of the reins, but will become slippery
in wet.</p>

<p>The <i>Bearing-Rein</i> is only used to keep up a horse’s
head and give him a showy appearance, therefore no
experienced person will use it except with that object,
and it is injurious in every other respect.—(<a href="#Page_52"><i>See</i> “Broken
Knees,” pages 52</a> and <a href="#Page_141">141</a>.)</p>

<p><i>Crupper.</i>—This strap is intended to keep the terret-pad
and back-band in their proper places, and to
restrain the former from running too far forward or
pressing on the withers (<a href="#Page_151"><i>see</i> “Sore Withers,” page
151</a>); also as a sustainer to the terret-pad against the
bearing-rein when the latter is strained into its hook.
Grooms have a very improper habit of leaving the
whole of the hinder part of the harness suspended in
one mass by the crupper-dock on a peg in the wall of
the harness-room; this should not be allowed. Let the
terret-pad when not in use be always placed across
a proper saddle-rack, with the britching and crupper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
suspended therefrom; or let them, at all events, be put
somewhere by themselves.</p>

<p><i>To put on Harness.</i>—First, while the horse’s head
is towards the manger, place the terret-pad loosely
across the back—take hold of the tail, and carefully
turn down the hair over the end of the flesh; thus
grasping and holding the tail and its hair together in
the left hand, with the right draw the crupper-dock
over it, and adjust the latter to its place at the root
of the tail, being careful <i>not</i> to leave a <i>single</i> loose
hair under it. Then arrange your terret-pad in the
place where it should work by shortening or lengthening
the crupper-strap; which done, tighten the belly-band.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Now turn the horse in his stall, and, your collar and
hames having been hung up close at hand, slip the
wide end of the former <i>by itself</i> over the head.</p>

<p>Leave the collar so, on the narrow part of the neck,
till you place your hames within the collar-rim, and
fasten them thereto by buckling the top strap over the
narrow part or top of the collar: now turn the collar
and hames round on the neck <i>in the direction</i> of the
<i>side</i> over which the <i>mane hangs</i>.</p>

<p>Put on the bridle and attach driving-reins, temporarily
doubling their hand-piece through the terrets.
Fasten the horse thus harnessed to the pillar-reins till
you are ready to “put to.”</p>

<p><i>To take off Harness</i>, begin by removing the reins and
bridle; then take off the hames <i>by themselves</i>, then the
collar, and lastly the terret-pad and crupper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<h3>DRIVING.</h3>

<p>In driving, a man should sit up against his work, and
be thoroughly propped by his legs and feet, with the
left or rein hand held well into his body, in front of
or a little below the waist. Nothing looks more ungraceful
than to have the reins at arm’s-length, held out
at a distance from one’s chest.</p>

<p>A driver should always be seated before any one else
in or about the vehicle; and having carefully taken a
firm hold of the reins in his left hand <span class="smcap">before</span> mounting
his seat, they should so remain, and never be shifted.
But should the driver be either obliged or find it convenient
to allow others to be seated first, he will then
of necessity have to mount from the off or right side,
in which case he will in the first place have to take the
reins in his right hand until seated, when he will at
once transfer them to their proper position in his left.</p>

<p>The whip should invariably be placed in the socket,
or be handed carefully to the driver after he has mounted.
To mount with it in hand is highly dangerous; the
sight of it over the blinkers, or an accidental touch to
an animal when the driver is unprepared, may startle
and set off a team—while holding a whip in the act of
mounting renders that piece of gymnastics doubly awkward
to accomplish. All turns and manœuvres may be
effected by the fore-finger (and thumb if necessary) of
the right or whip hand, either on the off or the near side
rein, according as the direction of the intended movement
is towards the right or left.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> But in driving four-in-hand,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
unicorns, or tandems, insert the fourth finger
of the whip-hand between the lead and wheel reins
on the side you want to pull, to turn or direct your
horses.</p>

<p>With four-in-hand the general principle is, while
allowing only a certain amount of play to the heads of
your leaders, to keep your wheelers well in hand, ready
for any sudden emergency, bearing in mind that it is
only with them, as they are attached to the pole, that
you can stop the carriage.</p>

<p>A driver having occasion to raise his right hand for
any purpose, should first place the whip transversely
under the thumb of the left or rein hand (above, but
upon, one of the reins), leaving the other hand at
liberty; indeed, the whip should always lie in this
transverse position, whether in the right or the left
hand, unless when in use for correction. Many horses
are very clever at watching the whip over the blinkers,
and careless pointing forward with it may keep a high-spirited
animal in a continual fret.</p>

<p>To ascertain how each horse is doing his work, judge
not only by the test of the willing horse bearing more
on your hand; see also how each horse keeps his
traces. In whichever case they are slack, you may
depend that <i>that</i> horse has no draught upon him; if
tight, he is doing his share of the work, or more. A
good whip will correct the defaulter so as to avoid annoying
the other horse. There is no better criterion of
skill in the use of the whip than this.</p>

<p>With the leaders in tandem and four-in-hand, and in
low-seated carriages, unless the dash-board be very high,
the reins are apt to get under the horses’ tails. In such
cases, to avoid a kicking match, no immediate attempt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
should be made to replace the reins while they are confined;
but a <i>very light</i> lash of the whip on the leg will
engage the attention of the animal, and while the tail
is switched up on the touch of the lash, the reins may
be released. Horses should always be kept well in hand,
unless that, upon a long and tiresome journey, some
consideration may be shown for what they have to go
through. Under such circumstances, attention may well
be directed to the manner the billets are placed in the
bit (<a href="#Page_62">page 62</a>).</p>

<p>On the level a fair pace can be maintained, but up
hill no merciful man will ever press his beasts. When
a heavy load has to be drawn up a sharp short hill, it
is not a bad plan to <i>cheat</i> the horse out of the first half
of it by going at it with an impetus, suffering the pace
to merge into a walk without further pressure as the
first impetus declines.</p>

<p>When the ascent is long and gradual, horses should
be allowed to walk the whole way, which can always
be admitted of on ordinary roads, where the pace is not
intended to exceed eight miles an hour, as the speed
may be accelerated when the fall of ground is reached,
without distressing the animals.</p>

<p>Let a man suppose himself to be obliged to wheel
a hand-cart with a heavy burden for a given distance
within a given time, on an undulating roadway, and he
will soon discover the course he would pursue to effect
his object; he would certainly save himself by going
very slowly up the hills, and make up the time and distance
with most ease by rolling the vehicle at a rapid
rate down the declivities. Let the principle of working
thus exemplified be always applied to the usage of
horses in harness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>An old driving maxim may be added, though not
recommended by the metre:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Up the hill spare me;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Down the hill let me run and bear me;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On the level never fear me.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Or,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Walk me a mile out and a mile in;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Up the hill spur me not,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Down the hill I’ll walk or trot;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On the plain spare me not;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the stable forget me not.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I have driven a great deal in my life, and have never
met with an accident from driving at a fair trot down
a moderate hill, with plenty of road-room, and no turning
to be made till after gaining the level, the team
being well in hand throughout.</p>

<p>This observation applies equally to any number of
horses; but with tandem or four-in-hand the wheelers
should be held particularly tight, and the leaders pulled
back.</p>

<p>If, in descending a hill, the wheel can be drawn along
rough stones without the horses being also brought on
them, it is desirable to avail of such a drag.</p>

<p>In such hilly countries as Wales, Devon, &amp;c., the
constant use of a skid is indispensable. The uninitiated
may not quarrel with me for reminding them of
the necessity for keeping always to their own or the left
side of the road(<i>the right on the Continent, in America,
and other countries</i>). In turning a corner, however, if
it be to the left you intend going, <i>before</i> you make
your turn get from your proper side of the road a <i>little</i>
towards the right, if possible, and from thence make
your turn, by which means you will more easily reach
the left, or your proper side, of the new route you intend
to take, besides being able to see everything that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
is approaching en the other. To turn a right angle
you must have space accordingly, and it is better to
make use of that which you see insured to you than to
be depending on that which is uncertain.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to remark that it is infinitely
safer to make your turns at a slow pace than faster.
Turning quickly round corners is reckless work, but the
faster your pace the more necessary it is to get to the
wrong side of the road when turning to the left <i>before</i>
you make your turn to the new, or <i>before</i> entering a
narrow gateway or passage. When the turn is to the
right, you will keep to your own or left side of the road.</p>

<p>Where a narrow gateway has to be entered with four
wheels, having brought your vehicle fairly in front of
it, place your pole directly over the centre or bolt stone;
in the absence of this guide, mark with your eye some
object in the centre, and bring your pole right over it.
The wheels will take care of themselves, if there is at
all room for the carriage.</p>

<p>With single harness the horse is brought direct at the
gate, and kept very straight, his hind feet passing over
the centre object.</p>

<p>In driving through crowded streets or in a narrow
way, especially with vehicles coming rapidly towards
you, and every prospect of a collision, take a stronger
hold of your horses, and moderate your pace, remembering
that, if you cannot avoid grief, the less the impetus
the less the crash, if it should come. This result is
amusingly exemplified by the stage-coachman’s definition
of the difference between the results of road and
rail accidents. Coachey says, “If even an upset occur
on the road, <i>there you are</i>; but if an accident takes
place by rail, <i>where are you</i>?”</p>

<p>Remember to collect your horses well in hand before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
you alter your course on the road, or to cross it, in
order to have them alert and handy for any emergency.</p>

<p>When travelling in damp weather, the roads being
sticky, half wet and dry, your horse requires saving
and consideration, no matter to what extent the wind
may be blowing, if it goes only in the <i>same direction
as himself</i>. When the roads are perfectly dry with a
light wind blowing <i>against</i> your horse, he travels under
the more favourable circumstances.</p>

<p>Neither blinkers nor bit should ever, upon any consideration,
be removed from a horse while he is attached
to a carriage, whether to feed or for any other purpose.
Want of caution in this respect has been a fertile source
of most serious accidents.</p>

<p><i>When a horse falls</i> irretrievably in harness, the
driver should avoid leaving his seat till some assistant
can go to the animal’s head, who, placing his coat or
some soft substance between it and the road, to prevent
injury to the eyes, presses one or both knees lightly on
the neck, but so as to prevent the beast from rising;
which done, the driver can get down from his seat, and,
availing of all the aid he can procure, frees all the harness
as rapidly as possible, and, running back the carriage
from the horse, assists him to rise. To disengage
buckles easily in such cases, instead of dragging at the
point of the strap in the usual way, force both ends of
it to the centre of the buckle, which will cause the
tongue to turn back, and so free the strap.</p>

<p>When a fall in harness occurs on slippery pavement
such as some of the London streets, or in frosty weather,
before the horse is permitted to make any effort to rise,
some ashes, dry clay, sand, sawdust, hay or straw, or
even any old rug or piece of cloth or carpet, should be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
so placed as to prevent him from slipping in his ineffectual
and distressing endeavours to recover his legs.</p>

<p><i>Backing.</i>—When a horse takes to backing, and danger
is threatened, if you cannot get him forward, and
have no assistant to take him by the head, the more
rapidly you bring the brute’s head to the point where
he aims at bringing his tail the better. It is a bad
<i>habit</i>, however, to give an animal, to allow of his being
taken by the head when he is obstreperous, and should
only be resorted to when quite unavoidable.</p>

<p><i>Kicking in Harness.</i>—When there is no kicking-strap
or other means of restraint available, and an animal
seems disposed to persist in kicking, the driver, <i>retaining
his seat</i>, should direct some one to hold up one of
the fore feet (if he finds a difficulty in doing so, doubling
the knee and tying a handkerchief tightly round it)
so as to prevent the foot reaching the ground, which
done, the driver may help to unharness, while the other
assistant takes hold of the horse’s head.</p>

<p><i>Shying.</i>—<a href="#Page_88">See page 88.</a></p>

<p><i>Runaways</i> are frequently checked by sawing the
mouth. In such cases, retain your presence of mind,
determined to stick to the ship to the last; if you have
the luck to meet with an ascent, that is your time to
get a pull.</p>

<p>A horse that has once run away, especially if, in connection
with that feat, he has met with any noisy disaster
or breakage, is <i>never, as long as he lives, safe to
drive again</i>. It only remains for his owner to use humanity
and judgment in disposing of him.</p>

<p><i>Stubborn horses</i>, or <i>jibbers</i>, in single harness.—On
the first appearance of this disposition at starting, the
neck should be examined, to discover whether the fit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
may not have been occasioned by indisposition to work
against an ill-fitting or dirty collar, which may have
produced abrasion or tenderness of the skin under it
(<a href="#Page_61"><i>see</i> page 61</a>). If the unpleasantness proceed from
innate stubbornness in the brute, and simple means
do not succeed in single harness, place him in double
harness, beside a well-tempered, good worker, that will
<i>drag him away</i>, starting <i>down-hill</i>. In this manner
the habit, if not confirmed, will be overcome. In <i>extreme</i>
cases, different appliances have been used with
varied success in making the beast move on—such as a
round pebble, about the size of a hen’s egg, placed in
the ear, and secured with a cord tied round the latter,
near the tip, or stuffing a glove in each ear. I have
also seen coachmen put two or three handfuls of mud
into the horse’s mouth, and rub it against his palate
with good effect, or tap him with a stick at the back of
the fore legs, just under the knee.</p>

<p>Letting a stubborn beast stand for hours in harness
in the spot where he has taken the fit, and, when he
has become well hungered, placing a feed of corn before
him and gradually walking away with it, is a dilatory
proceeding sometimes resorted to, but scarcely worth
mentioning.</p>

<h3>DRAWING.</h3>

<p>The size of horses should be in proportion to the
weight and size of the vehicle and loads they are intended
to move, upon the principle, easily demonstrated
by experiment, that weight drags weight. For instance,
a horse having to drag a cart up a hill, will do
so more easily with the driver on his back than otherwise,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
as the weight of the man assists the horse against
the weight he has to move. The latter part of this
argument only refers, however, to short distances, or to
starting a draught.</p>

<p>The higher the wheels are, and the closer together,
whether they be two or four, the lighter will be the
draught. In fact, to render the draught as easy as possible,
the axles ought to be on a level with the trace-hooks,
or point of traction, or as nearly horizontal as
possible with the traces and their place in the leg of
the hames. It is self-evident that if a horse has to be
pulling <i>up</i>, it is like his having to raise a certain part
of the weight of the carriage with every step he moves;
and the faster he goes, the more injuriously does this
principle operate against him.</p>

<p>The point of the pole-and-chain attachment should be
always so elevated from its insertion in the carriage as
to be on a level with the rings of the hames through
which the pole-chains pass. On the point of the pole
should be a revolving steel cross-tree, from eight to ten
inches in length, in the ends of which the pole-chains
or leathers are inserted. The working of this contrivance
will, to any practical man, demonstrate its utility.</p>

<p>In light double harness, I much prefer using swinging-bars
instead of one inflexible splinter-bar, unless for
very heavy draught. Horses should be placed close to
their work. For adjusting the traces to that effect, <a href="#Page_58">see
page 58</a>.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that the farther forward in
a carriage the weight to be drawn is placed, the easier
will be the draught on the horse. Thus the weight of
one man at the extreme end of the vehicle (like a conductor
on an omnibus) has as much effect on the traction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
as that of two men on or near the driving-seat.
The deader the weight, let it be placed as it may, the
greater the trial of the horse; therefore inanimate
matter is heavier on traction than anything having life.</p>

<p>Vehicles of which the lower carriage and axles are
kept braced together by a perch steadying the action of
the wheels, are much the easiest on the draught. The
Americans are well aware of the advantages of such a
construction for encountering the roughness of many of
their roads. Not only are all their pleasure carriages,
or “buggies,” so constructed, but the waggons have a
perch that by an admirable arrangement can be detached,
to allow of the carriage being lengthened when
required to carry timber or other lading. The perch,
being in two pieces, can be coupled by the simple contrivance
of a movable iron band and pin, giving a
freedom, most desirable in a rough country, to the
movement of the lower carriage. This contrivance
works well, and might with advantage be applied to
our military train-waggons and ambulance-carts. Horses
cannot but suffer from the present construction of carriages
in general use, where the axles are left unsupported
and unbraced to encounter the roughness and
inequalities of the road.</p>

<p><i>Axle-Boxes.</i>—Proper lubrication of the axle-boxes is
too often sadly neglected. Even Collinge’s patent will
not run freely without periodical aid in proportion to
use, and it is no harm to make an occasional examination
of the wheels of a carriage when they are lifted off
the ground by setters, to see that there is thorough
freedom in the working of them, by spinning them
round with one’s finger against the spokes. The reapplication
of gutta-percha or leather washers is essential,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
as the amount of friction by work will wear that
requisite.</p>

<p>For a few days after the washers are replaced, the
boxes should not be screwed too tightly, but subsequently
they should be re-tightened. The noise of
wheels joggling upon their axles indicates want of
screwing up, or of washers.</p>

<p>A round tire is decidedly easier for draught than a
flat-edged one.</p>

<p><i>Carriages</i>, immediately after use, should be cleaned,
or at least have water dashed over them, to prevent the
mud from drying on the paint, which can scarcely fail
to deteriorate it, and give it a premature appearance of
wear.</p>

<h3>SHOEING.</h3>

<p>Some horses are very averse to being shod, through
some fright the first time of shoeing, or bad management.
It is better to overcome such shyness or vice
by gentleness or stratagem than by force of any kind.</p>

<p>Some few animals even require to be cast, or placed
under the influence of the painful twitch. Before resorting
to any force, however, the following means
should be tried in preference to others:—Let whoever
is in the habit of riding or exercising the horse <i>mount
him</i> when regularly bridled and saddled, the girths being
a little looser that if intended for work; ride to the
side of the forge, and there let him (his rider still on his
back) be shod the first time; on the second visit to the
forge, if it be spacious enough, he may be ridden into it
for the same purpose.</p>

<p>In shoeing, the smith’s rule ought to be to fit the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
shoe to the foot, <i>not the foot to the shoe</i>, according to
the general practice of those gentry.</p>

<p>In London and all large towns, the best thing a gentleman
can do is to contract with a veterinary surgeon
for the shoeing as well as the doctoring of his horses.</p>

<p>The night previous to a horse being shod or removed,
the groom should stop his feet, to soften them, and enable
the farrier to use his drawing-knife properly, and
without injury to that instrument.</p>

<p>In shoeing, any <i>undue</i> accumulation of sole may be
pared away; judgment must, however, be used in this
particular, as the feet of some animals grow more sole
than others, and superfluous increase tends to contraction,
whereas care must be taken not to weaken the sole
of ordinary growth. I am aware that great difference
of opinion exists on this subject, but I speak from practical
experience of the results of opposite modes of treatment
in this particular.</p>

<p>If no shoes were used, the wear and tear of work
would provide for the disposal of this accumulation,
which, as nature is interfered with by the use of shoes,
must be artificially removed.</p>

<p>If the frog be jagged it may be pared even, but the
sound parts should not be cut away, and on no account
should the smith’s drawing-knife be allowed to divide
the bars or returns of the foot—an operation technically
called by the trade “opening the heels,” to which fallacious
practice farriers are pertinaciously addicted, because,
in some one case of dreadfully contracted feet,
they may have seen or heard of temporary relief being
given by this process, with the natural result, which
they ignore, of the remedy proving itself in time worse
than the disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>If farriers are allowed, they will almost invariably
drive as many shoe-nails round the inside quarter as the
outside. This is a lamentable mistake, especially regarding
the fore feet, as the foot being thus nearly all
round confined to the shoe, its proper action is interfered
with, preventing a possibility of its natural and
gradual expansion in action from the toe towards the
heel, as the horse lays his foot upon the ground, with
all weight, as well as the act of propulsion, pressed
on it.</p>

<p>The reason for liberating the inside quarter in preference
to the outside is, that the inside, being more under
the centre of gravity, will be found to expand and contract
more than the outside, as will be proved by the
removal and examination of a shoe that has been in use
three or four weeks. On observing the part of the shoe
that has been next the foot, it will be distinctly perceived
that the friction of the inside quarter of the foot
has worn a cavity in the portion of the shoe which has
been under that quarter of the foot, while the side that
has been under the outside quarter bears comparatively
little evidence of friction above it.</p>

<p>This being an established fact, it seems desirable that
the full number of nails should be driven round the outside
quarter, and not more than one or two (for hunting
purposes) on the inside from the toe. (Six nails altogether
is the cavalry regulation.)</p>

<p>If your horses are not quick wearers on the road, the
fore shoes should be removed within two or three weeks
after shoeing (care being taken that the clenches of the
nails in the hind feet are at the same time properly
levelled to the hoof to prevent brushing), and let them
be re-shod every five or six weeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>In all foot ailments, whenever a horse is lame, although
the disease may not apparently be in the foot,
let the shoe first be carefully removed, and the shoeless
foot examined by as competent a farrier as can be procured
(in the absence of a veterinary surgeon), by pincers
round the nail-holes, gently pressing wall and sole
together, by the hammer tapping the sole, and a judicious
use of the drawing-knife, to detect the possible seat
of disease.</p>

<p>I have known a lame horse to be brought to a reputedly-experienced
amateur horse-doctor, the cause of disease
being so evidently inflammation of the sheath of
the tendon, that the animal was ordered to be treated
accordingly—viz., with cold applications; and this not
succeeding, firing the leg was resorted to, after which,
the weather being suitable, it was thought expedient to
let the beast have a run at grass. As a preliminary
the shoes were removed, in the course of which operation
a bed of gravel was found to have secreted itself
in the foot of the supposed diseased leg, and the inflammation
occasioned by the gravel having gone up,
caused what appeared to be <i>marked</i> disease about the
tendon.</p>

<p>Such were the results of neglecting the precautions
here recommended.</p>

<p><i>Brushing</i>, or cutting, is a very tormenting weakness
in the horse, whether behind or before, and often highly
dangerous in the latter case.</p>

<p>The ordinary practice of farriers under such circumstances
is to rasp away the inside quarter of the offending
hoof, as well as doubly thickening the shoe under
the weakened wall, leaving the toe to extend itself
forward. This is a great mistake, yielding only a temporary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
improvement, not at all tending towards a cure.
On the contrary, it would be better to shorten the toes
by degrees; and on no account should a rasp be put near
the wall of the inside quarter, in order to let it get as
strong as possible towards the heel.</p>

<p>I would certainly allow no nails to be driven inside,
but let the shoe be fastened round the outer quarter of
the foot, the shoe itself being of equal thickness on both
quarters as an ordinary shoe; but on putting it on, it
should not be suffered to project outside the inside quarter,
and the <i>shoes</i> might <i>here</i> be rasped to guard against
rough edges, which might injure the pastern of the opposite
leg during work.</p>

<p>A strong clip should also be thrown up on the outside
quarters of these shoes to catch the wall and effectually
prevent them from shifting towards or projecting beyond
the inside quarter, which might cause them to
come in contact with the opposite pastern-joint while in
motion. Until the brushing be somewhat remedied,
an india-rubber ring or a bit of leather, and elastic
strap round the pastern, will prevent it from receiving
present injury. If the above treatment is attended to
and persevered in, the probability is that in nine cases
out of ten a cure will be effected in course of time.</p>

<p><i>Corns.</i>—Every horse-owner ought to make himself
acquainted with the part of the sole between the frog
and the wall on the inside quarter of the fore foot,
called the seat of corns (<a href="#Page_131"><i>see</i> pages 131</a> and <a href="#Page_140">140</a>), and
every time that a horse is shod or removed, in paring
the foot the drawing-knife should be used to clean
away this cavity (without weakening the adjacent wall),
where the disease originates from undue pressure of the
shoe on the <i>inside</i> quarter of that susceptible spot, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
from friction of the coffin-bone, on the inside of the
sole, above the seat of corn. The shoe ought to rest
<i>entirely</i> on the <i>wall</i> of the foot, and not on <i>any</i> part of
the <i>sole</i>.</p>

<p><i>Roughing</i> and <i>Frosting</i> is simply drawing out the
old nails about the toes and replacing them with very
large sharp-headed ones, called frost-nails. Horse-nails
being made purposely of a soft metal, are unfit for
frosting, as the heads wear down so quickly. If
smiths would <i>steel</i> the <i>heads</i> of frost-nails, they would
last much longer. This precaution against slipping,
however, is only effectual in slight frosts. In regular
frosting, the nails are carried completely round, with
the addition of sharp calkins being turned on the heels
of all four feet, and sometimes also short spikes or
cogs turned down from the toes; but the latter are
common only in severe climates, though their use is
quite as desirable in England, especially to assist horses
in ascending slippery hills, where the cogs on the heels
have little or no hold in the ground. Cogs or calkins
should be rasped by the smith, to sharpen them, every
couple of days.</p>

<p>Although it may be inconvenient and expensive to
have horses prepared in frosty weather, it is highly
necessary to do so where work is required of them.
The very extraordinary exertion that is needed on the
part of the animal to keep his feet when unprepared,
as well as the fret to his energies, takes a vast deal
more out of him in one day’s work than a month’s
daily use would do under ordinary circumstances, not
to speak of the risk of pecuniary loss from accident.</p>

<p>It is a most pitiable thing to see the poor beasts
struggling in their high courage and good temper to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
do their best, for what I can only call cruel or thoughtless
masters, to say nothing of the liability of the
animals’ breaking their knees and bringing their riders
or drivers to serious trouble, smashing harness and
vehicles, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I have always found servants most ingenious in
making objections to having their horses prepared for
frost, the grand secret being their anxiety to keep them
in the stable the whole time the frost lasts, that they
may be saved from the trouble of cleaning either them
or their caparison, carriages, &amp;c. They will alarm you
with the stereotyped objections, “tearing the horses’
feet to pieces,” “driving fresh nail-holes,” “ripping off
shoes,” “his feet won’t bear a shoe after,” &amp;c. I never
knew an ordinary sound foot to be reduced to such a
condition, by simply changing shoes, that a good smith
could not fasten a shoe on.</p>

<p>The only tangible objection to calkins to which attention
need be drawn is, that during their use, unless the
horse is moved about in his stable with great caution
in cleaning or otherwise, he is apt to tread with them
on the coronet of the opposite foot, which is a very
serious affair, inflicting a nasty jagged wound on one of
the most sensitive vascular parts of the animal.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Bar Shoe</i> going all round the foot is intended to
protect weak or thrushy heels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p><i>Wide-webbed</i> or <i>Surface Shoes</i> are used with flat-footed,
weak-soled horses: leather being often introduced
above them to save the soles from being damaged
by extraneous substances on the road. Put on with the
ordinary shoe, it is said to lessen the jar of the tread.</p>

<p><i>High-heeled Shoes</i>, when a horse is laid up, properly
managed, prove a most effectual palliation and aid in the
cure of “clap of the back sinew” (<a href="#Page_143">page 143</a>).</p>

<p>These shoes are made with calkins (joined by a light
iron bar), which should not be heavy, not more than an
inch deep, and gradually reduced by the smith as the
disease abates.</p>

<p><i>Steeling the Toes</i> is necessary with quick wearers on
the road; but particular cautions should be given to
the smith to work the steel well into the iron, for any
protrusion of this hard metal above the iron will occasion
tripping, and possibly an irrecoverable fall.</p>

<p><i>Calking</i> the hind shoes moderately on the outside
quarter only, is most essential to the hunter to prevent
slipping, and to give him confidence in going at his
fences, and on landing. Its advantages can be well
understood by any sportsman who has experienced the
difference between walking himself a day’s simple
shooting over soft slippery ground, or taking a ten-mile
walk on a half-wet road, in each case in boots with
headed nails, to enable him to have a hold in the
ground, and undertaking the same exercises in boots
without nails, where one wearies himself with efforts to
keep his feet.</p>

<p>I speak as a practical man, having probably come to
less grief than most others in hunting, which may be
attributed mainly to the particular attention bestowed
on the calking of my bearers when I was a hard goer.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
It seems an unimportant matter, but if looked into will
be found to be far otherwise.</p>

<p><i>Tips</i>, or half-shoes, which cover little more than the
toe of a horse, leaving the heels to come in direct contact
with the ground, are particularly serviceable in
cases where the heels are disposed to contraction, and,
from my experience, can be used without injury in any
ordinary description of work while the frog is sound.</p>

<p>The quarters of the feet being left by their use without
the usual confinement of the shoe, and being pressed
to expansion on every movement of the animal, naturally
become strong and extended. Tips should become
gradually thinner, finishing in a fine edge towards the
ends. I have seen ill-made tips calculated to lame any
horse, with the ends the thickness of an ordinary shoe
(though extending, which is the intention of tips, less
than half-way down the foot), as if the smith who made
them expected the heels to remain always suspended in
mid air.</p>

<p><i>Slippers.</i>—Regular sportsmen generally carry a spare
shoe while hunting; but if a shoe comes off one of the
fore feet in the field or on the road, and the rider is
not provided with a proper shoe, he should at once
dismount and lead his bearer to the nearest forge,
where an old shoe most approaching to the size of the
foot that can possibly be found should be selected from
the heap of cast ones that generally lies by in a forge,
and let it be tacked on with three or four nails only, so
as to serve the creature to get home, or until the proper
shoe can be made.</p>

<p>If a shoe comes off the hind foot, and the distance
from home is not above three or four miles, the animal
can be led or occasionally ridden that far without injury,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
especially if the softest side of the road be selected
for the track, the hind feet being generally much stronger
than the fore.</p>

<p><i>Travelling.</i>—The day before a long journey, look to
your horse’s shoes; see that the clinches are well laid
down and the shoes nailed tightly. As a rule, do not
have new shoes put on just before a journey, for the
least carelessness in fitting or nailing them may occasion
more or less lameness; should it be severe, disappointment
and delay may result; while if only apparently
slight at starting, and the animal endure the pain
patiently during its work, the cause being in existence
throughout will produce its effects only too palpably
when the day’s journey is over. If old shoes are nearly
worn, but will last the journey, let them by all means
remain on; but directly the work is over, send for any
proper smith whose forge is nearest, and have them
taken off in the stable. Should the forge not be at
hand, the old slippers can of course be tacked on when
the horse, having had its rest, is taken to be shod.
All shoes, for road-work especially, should be made full
long to cover the heels. It should be borne in mind
that, as the hoof grows naturally, the shoe is brought
forward and thereby exposes the heels.</p>

<h3>VICE.</h3>

<p>In all cases where active vice, such as rearing, kicking,
jibbing, plunging, has to be combated, the work of
correction is half done if the horse is well tired in the
first instance, or, in vulgar terms, “the fiery edge taken
off him,” by half an hour’s rapid loungeing, with his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
neck well bent, chin into chest, on the softest and most
tiring ground that is available. For myself, if I find
a horse vicious, I never think of combating him if it
can be helped, without having first reduced his vigour
a little; and all horsemen who undertake to conquer
any seriously bad habits are recommended to consider
and adopt this practice, if indeed such is not already
their custom.</p>

<p><i>Kicking</i>, to the horseman, is a matter of very trifling
consideration. He may either amuse himself by letting
the ebullition expend itself, or it may be stopped
by chucking up the horse’s head and increasing the pace.</p>

<p><i>Kicking in Harness</i> is a different affair, being generally
the prelude to disaster, and must be guarded against.—<a href="#Page_58"><i>See</i>
page 58.</a></p>

<p><i>Kicking in the Stable.</i>—Many animals, most gentle
in other respects, take inordinate fits of this practice,
and generally in the dead of night, as if to make up
for their usual quietude on all other occasions; most
frequently they resort to the amusement without any
apparent cause of irritation whatever. They will do it
when alone or when in company; while, were it not for
the capped hock and otherwise disfigured legs, as well
as the dilapidated stabling behind them, discovered in
the morning, you would think that “butter wouldn’t
melt in their mouths.” In other cases the habit proceeds
from obvious bad temper or spite towards a
neighbour. There are many cures proposed for kicking
in the stable. One frequently successful is a round
log of wood, four or five inches long and about two in
diameter, with a staple at one end of it, through which
a chain two or three inches long is passed and attached
to a strap that buckles round the pastern (just above<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
the coronet) of one hind leg, or a log in this way to
each hind leg may be used if necessary. Another
means is to pad all parts of the stable that can be
reached by the hind feet. In many instances where
this plan is adopted, the animal, no longer hearing any
noise suggesting to his fancy resistance from behind,
will cease kicking altogether, from no other explainable
cause. For padding use some pads of hay or oaten
straw, covered with coarse canvass, and nailed to all
places within reach of his heels. Sometimes, where
the habit is supposed to arise from spite towards a
neighbour, a change of location will answer. In other
cases nothing but arming all parts of the stable within
reach with furze bushes, or other prickly repellants,
will succeed.</p>

<p>It will be well, in treating this vice, to try the remedies
here recommended in rotation; first with the
otherwise quiet horse try the log, then the padding,
the change of location, and the prickly armour in succession.
It is a remarkable fact that horses seldom
kick in the stable during daylight; leaving a light in
the stable through the night may therefore effect a cure
where all else has failed; but as light interferes with
sleep, it should be the very last resource.</p>

<p><i>Rearing</i> is of little consequence in harness, and seldom
attempted to any extent; but to the rider it is, in
my opinion, the most dangerous of all bad habits to
which a brute may be addicted. As I consider it
almost impossible for a horseman to cure a practised
rearer, my advice to the owner of such a beast would
be, instead of risking his life in the endeavour, to get
rid of him to some buyer, who will place him where,
in the penal servitude of harness, he may perhaps eke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
out a useful existence. However, should accident place
you on a rearer, directly he rises lay hold of the mane
with one hand; this, while at once throwing your
weight forward where it should be, will enable you also
to completely slacken the reins, which is important.</p>

<p>No one need be ashamed to adopt this plan. I have
seen the best riders do so.</p>

<p>Vicious rearing may, on its first manifestation, be
sometimes checked by a determined and reckless rider
giving a well-directed blow on the ear with some bothering
missile; but this is a venturesome proceeding, and
only in emergency should it be resorted to, as an ill-directed
blow is very likely to produce poll-evil, or
knock the sight out of an eye.</p>

<p>It is said that a bottle full of water, broken on the
ear of a rearing horse, proves an effectual cure; but
happily the danger to the rider during such treatment
of his bearer, is a strong guarantee against the frequent
adoption of this barbarous practice. In many cases
lowering one hand with the rein on that side when the
horse is just beginning to rise, will have the effect of
breaking the rear, the horse being urged forward with
the spur the instant his fore legs are down; but if,
when he has gained anything like the perpendicular,
the rein or head be chucked, or by any misfortune interfered
with, the chances are that the brute will walk
about on his hind legs like a dancing dog, and most
likely finish by falling back on his rider.</p>

<p>A martingal is sometimes found to be a preventive,
especially a running one.</p>

<p><i>Jibbing.</i>—The disposition to this vice is generally
called into action, in the first instance, by the fret consequent
on the abrasion of the neck by the collar, or by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
the working of uneven traces (<a href="#Page_57">page 57</a>). The use of a
saving-collar, and the careful adjustment of the traces,
may therefore obviate the propensity.</p>

<p>Sometimes jibbing is the effect of bad handling when
starting with a heavy load. Where such a disposition
evinces itself, the carriage should be pushed from behind,
or another horse placed beside, or, if possible, in
front of the jibber, to lead him off.</p>

<p><i>Shying</i> may proceed from various causes, such as
defective sight, nervousness, or tricks; thus it may be
the result of either constitutional infirmity or of vice.
From whatever cause proceeding, the proper way to
manage a shying horse is to turn his head <i>away from</i>
the object at which he shies, in riding, pressing the
spur to the same side to which his head is turned; thus,
if the object he dislikes be on the right, turn his head
to the left, and press your left leg, giving him that
spur, and <i>vice versa</i>, according to the side on which the
object to be avoided is found. If you have to deal
with a bad shyer, your time being precious, and you
only care to get through your present ride with the
least unpleasantness possible, in addition to the above-mentioned
means, take him, if necessary, well by the
head, the reins in each hand, and saw or job his mouth
rather sharply, keeping him in rapid motion till you
pass the object.</p>

<p>Operating thus on his mouth <i>severely</i>, if necessary,
will engage his attention, and cheat him out of his apprehension
for the moment. It is bad horsemanship,
and dangerous besides, to force a horse’s head <i>towards</i>
an offending object while in motion; but if it is
particularly desirable that the animal should become
familiarised with anything of which he is shy, let him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
be brought to a standstill, and coaxed up gradually to
it, that he may assure himself of its harmlessness by
smelling and feeling it with his nose and lips, if possible.
Punishment by whip or spur—what is called “cramming”
him up to a thing—is a vile error.</p>

<p>When a horse is found to evince a confirmed objection
to passing a particular place, and that he keeps
bolting and turning viciously in spite of all ordinary
efforts to prevent it, take him at his own fancy, and
keep turning and turning him till he is so tired of that
game that he will only be too glad to go forward past
the objectionable spot. A horse’s sense of smelling is
very acute, and sometimes a dead animal in the ditch
or field by the side of the road, though unseen, will
cause an abrupt and very unseating sort of a shy, with
an ordinarily quiet beast of sensitive olfactory nerves.</p>

<h3>SELLING.</h3>

<p>If the horse you wish to dispose of be a fancy one,
either for beauty, action, or disposition, and a fancy
price be required, efforts must be made to obtain the
fancy customer to suit, and time and attention must be
devoted to that object. But if he be of the ordinary
useful class, unless a purchaser be found at once, let
the owner, directly he has made up his mind to part
with him, think of the best market available, whether
public auction, a fair, or private sale by commission.</p>

<p>The public auction, with a good description of the
animal’s merits, if he has any, is the readiest and least
troublesome mode of disposing of all unsuitable property;
and from my own experience, I should say that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
the better plan is to make up one’s mind positively
to dispose of such the first time it is put up by the
auctioneer, having, of course, placed a reasonable and
rather low reserve price on it, and provided that the
sale be fairly attended by purchasers; otherwise I should
not allow my property to be offered until a more favourable
opportunity.</p>

<p>A valuable and fancy animal, if his owner is not
pressed to sell, had better be disposed of by full advertisement
and private sale at his own stable. It is bad
management to exhibit for sale an animal that is out of
condition; it always pays to make your horse look as
well as possible before he meets the eye of a customer.
There is an old and true saying, “no meat sells so well
as horse meat”—of course animal flesh is here alluded to.</p>

<h3>CAPRICE.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></h3>

<p>All horsemen know how whimsical horses are, and
the best riders feel a certain amount of diffidence, and
even awkwardness, on beginning with any new mount,
until a more perfect acquaintance is established between
man and horse.</p>

<p>A horseman who identifies himself with his steed will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
sometimes by a mere fluke hit off the means of having
his own way with a capricious though perhaps really
well-disposed animal, if one only knew the way to
manage him.</p>

<p>For instance, a first-class hunter of my own (Baronet),
whose excellent performance in the field, where I had
seen him tried, induced me to purchase him, soon gave
evidence of a peculiarity for which, unknown to me,
he had made himself remarkable. No ordinary means
could prevail upon him to go through any street of a
town except such as he pleased himself, of which he
gave me evidence the first day I had occasion to try him
in that way, walking on his hind legs directly his will
was disputed on the subject, even to the extent of a
mere pressure on the rein at the side he was required
to turn. In my difficulty, instinct prompted me to drop
the reins and gently direct his progress with the point
of the whip at the side of his nose, and in this way he
went ever after as quiet as a sheep with me. Having
discovered his caprice, I was always provided with a
handle of a whip or a switch of some kind for his benefit.
Riding him one day into Dycer’s, an old acquaintance
of his, well aware of his propensity, exclaimed in
terms not complimentary to Baronet at my possession
of him, and was much amused when I told him my
simple method of managing this self-willed gentleman.</p>

<p>The same sort of what I can scarcely help terming
“instinct” that has often taught me, and doubtless
hundreds of other practical horsemen, to meet the whims
of their steeds so as to suit themselves, produced a victory
somewhat similar to the foregoing over an animal
that, in the presence of a large assemblage interested in
his performance, most determinedly refused to <i>trot</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
though ridden successively by the most skilled nagsmen
Dycer’s yard could produce, as well as by Dycer
himself.</p>

<p>I proposed to try my hand, and the animal at first
start pursued the same uneasy half-canter with me; but
perceiving that he seemed particularly desirous to take
a drink from a trough that happened to be in the way,
I allowed his attention to be distracted by taking as
much water as he pleased from it; and then turning
him in the opposite direction from that in which he had
so obstinately persisted in his own gait, patting and
doing all I could to reassure him, dropping the bit-rein
altogether, and taking a very light and lengthened hold
of the snaffle-rein, I let him move off at his own pace,
which, to the surprise of every one present (my own, I
admit, included), proved to be a walk, which he immediately
changed into a jog-trot all up the yard, winning
for me a bet of twenty sovereigns to one from the late
Edward Dycer, that the horse could not be made to trot
within a quarter of an hour of the rider mounting.</p>

<p>Now, it is only caprice that can account for the likes
and dislikes of horses about going lead or wheel in
four-in-hand. One horse will not stir till removed from
the wheel, and another will be equally unmanageable if
assigned the leader’s part, while an exchange of places
will perhaps render both animals perfectly tractable.</p>

<p>In double harness it may sometimes be observed
that an animal, while working by itself, or with others
not faster, will casually show great spirit, but when
coupled with another possessing more life and action,
it will seem at once subdued from its former liveliness,
and go along like a slug, quite out of sorts at finding
itself outpaced, &amp;c., while its more sprightly neighbour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
will exhibit a double ebullition of spirits, as if in reproach
to say, “Why can’t you come on?” To prove
such cases of whimsicality further, replace the apparent
sluggard by coupling with our vivacious steed a more
lively and active animal, and you will see the latter in
his turn become subdued and “shut up,” in comparison
with his previous sprightliness.</p>

<p>Again, although the animal is decidedly gregarious,
a horse, from some dislike to its companions or other
whim, will absolutely pine and cease to thrive in a stall
stabled with others, and be restored to its usual spirits
and health on removal to a loose-box. Such animals
are generally restless at night, and show great ability in
smashing their head-collars.</p>

<p>On the other hand, most horses like company, and
will pine away if kept alone.</p>

<p>These things should be studied.</p>

<h3>IRISH HUNTERS, AND THE BREEDING OF GOOD HORSES.</h3>

<p>Much attention has latterly been attracted to the
deterioration in the superior breeds of horses, having
reference more to a decline of power and endurance
than to diminished swiftness.</p>

<p>There is no reason why our old fame for breeding
good horses of every kind should not be maintained.
Unrelaxed attention must nevertheless be given to some
well-known and established rules respecting breeding,
and more marked encouragement might with advantage
be in every way afforded to the production and rearing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
of young animals of a superior and valuable description.
We would therefore suggest that prizes for young ones
should be more liberally and generally awarded at
exhibitions; likewise a careful revision and alteration
of many of the present regulations in connection with
racing.</p>

<p>The importance of most careful scrutiny in selecting
the progenitors of horses can never be overrated; and
though in Ireland experience has proved in many instances
that a good hunter can be produced from a dam
which, in England, would be considered too small, too
plain, the <i>blood</i> in both parents has invariably been of
the best. The mare, or perhaps her parents, might
have been half-starved—no uncommon result of the
scarcity of food during many successive years of adversity
among the poorer classes in the former country—but
her progenitors had been large powerful animals.</p>

<p>As, in the due course of things, it results in time that
every denomination of useful horse, excepting, perhaps,
the heavy dray and cart horse breeds, is influenced by
the characteristics transmitted more particularly to the
powerful, enduring, moderately fleet animal properly
designated the hunter, it is a subject of deep interest
to the community at large to know how the latter
should be produced.</p>

<p>The “Irish hunter” is admitted to possess in a remarkable
manner the qualities most desirable in a horse
of that or the generally useful class. Hardy, enduring,
courageous, strong, short-legged, short-backed, long-sided,
tolerably fast, but any deficiency in speed made
up for by jumping power; all action, able to jump anything
and everything; intuitive lovers of fencing; their
sagacity such that you have only to get on their backs
and leave the rest to themselves;—under ordinary
circumstances it is almost impossible to throw these
animals.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;" id="illus5">
<img src="images/illus5.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE PROPER FORM</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>Such is the breeding that I should be inclined to
cross with that of the powerful English race-horse as
sire, taking blood as nearly pure as possible in both
parents, for the purpose of securing valuable stock,
which would in time be dispersed over the country,
and replace the progeny of those weedy thorough-breds
which, in Ireland especially, have done much towards
the decline in power and endurance of the present
generation of so-called Irish hunters. The parentage
might, of course, be reversed between sire and dam.</p>

<p>As to the question of climate, any one really interested
in discovering its possible effects might be curious
to know what would characterise the produce of a high-bred
English racer and Irish huntress foaled and reared
in France.</p>

<p>As far as we can judge from the peculiarities of those
horses with which we are most familiar, extremes of
either heat or cold are unfavourable to the development
of <i>size</i>; whereas, under both conditions, a vast amount
of endurance seems to be natural.</p>

<p>The Norwegian and the Arab, differing materially in
point of swiftness, are both notorious for endurance.
The plodding perseverance of the first is well known;
while the Arab, ridden at an even gait with a fair
weight, will go with impunity a greater distance, at a
rate of eighteen to twenty miles an hour, than the best
European can do. In sporting language, the Arab can
“stay” better than the European.</p>

<p>Arab breeders rarely offer a really high-bred animal
for sale under four, and generally five, years of age;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
hence he cannot receive the education bestowed upon
the European racer, who, before he is three, often at
less than two, years of age, is taught by the most
scientific riders in the world to “go from the post” at
very nearly top speed—a species of training that sometimes
results in his beating horses which are really
superior in every respect except that of being ready at
starting, and capable of putting on their best speed at
once. Besides, in those hot climates the young animal
has not the advantage of a soft elastic turf, so essential
to training, nor has he the assistance of proper trainers
and jockeys.</p>

<p>It is much to be regretted that the breeders of Arabia
cannot be tempted, for almost any price, to part with
truly high-bred mares, wisely retaining them to breed
for the benefit of their native land.</p>

<p>Warmth of climate seems thus, as instanced in the
Arab, to favour swiftness and endurance; though, on
the other hand, we may point to the mild, moist, but
scarcely warm climate of our islands, as having fostered
the production of animals possessing these qualities in
the first degree, in addition to size and power beyond
those of the Arab.</p>

<p>France has latterly, since the introduction of pure
blood, produced some splendid horses; but time must
tell whether the perfections of these animals are as
lasting as those of others whose early growth may not
have been so much forced by a more genial climate.
Therefore, as far as we know at present, the climate of
England is as favourable as that of any other land to
the production and development of perfection in the
horse, the specimens of which that she has presented
being hitherto unsurpassed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>

<p>It would appear that we make a serious mistake in
not providing greater encouragement to breeders and
purchasers of yearlings and two-years-old of the different
descriptions. A decided advantage would, we
think, result from competition among these classes at
horse-shows, due care being necessarily given to placing
them in a situation specially adapted for them, and
where they would be free from noise and excitement.
Nothing would tend more to incite to the careful breeding
of horses among farmers than the possibility of obtaining
handsome prizes, and thereby securing the prospect
of early remuneration; while the opportunity for market
afforded by these exhibitions would present additional
inducements to the rearing and purchase of young
animals. Having in view the encouragement of a
superior breed of horses, it is beginning at the wrong
end not to support it, in the first place, by allotting at
such meetings the most numerous and valuable prizes
to the babies.</p>

<p>Fortunately the ventilation given to this important
subject of the deterioration in our horses, more especially
in that particular class denominated the Irish
hunter, has aroused the interest of the country at large,
and already led to more earnest efforts on the part of
the landed proprietors and breeders to regain lost
ground.</p>

<p>It ought to be borne in mind that the light weights
allowed by the present racing laws for Queen’s plates
are, as examples for weighting in other races, most pernicious.
These grants from the Crown were originally
bestowed with the view to encourage the raising of
strong thorough-breds, capable of carrying twelve stone
sometimes for four or even five mile heats; therefore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
the present arrangement of weights is positively, however
unintentionally, a misapplication of those public
funds.</p>

<p>It is probably to the turfmen that the change in the
character of steeplechasing is greatly due; they found
it their interest gradually to alter the weights and distances,
so as to bring profitably into play their second
and third rate beaten race-horses. Steeplechases were
not intended for these latter, whose perfection is in
proportion to their speed. Pace is not the chief desideratum
in hunters, to prove the qualities of which
steeple or castle chases were instituted; power and
endurance are at least as essential: and it is contrary
to the law of nature, as well as of mechanics, to combine
a maximum of speed with that of power, and <i>vice
versa</i>. Either will preponderate to the detriment of
the other.</p>

<p>The difficulties, natural and artificial, presented by
the general face of the country in Ireland, have no
doubt contributed to the development of those qualities
which render the Irish hunter so valuable. The style
of fence is continually varied; and in the course of a
run there will be encountered double ditches, with a
narrow or wide bank, single ones, stone walls, brooks,
bullfinches, gates, wide drains, and occasionally posts
and rails, or iron palings—hurdles being, however, of
rare occurrence; but the horse that can master the
above impediments to his course will soon find out
how to jump a hurdle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;" id="illus6">
<img src="images/illus6.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PREPARATORY CANTER</p>
</div>

<p>The Irish colt has sometimes also a kind of training
not expressly designed for him by his owner; for being
not unfrequently left with other animals in a field
affording an insufficient supply of grass for them all,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
he undertakes to prove the truth of the proverb that
hunger will break through stone walls, by jumping
over if not through one to obtain more or better food.</p>

<p>Transplanted to England, the accomplished Irish
hunter often finds himself tested in a manner strange
to him; the rate of speed is greater than he has been
accustomed to, for the Green Isle has not yet adopted
generally the extremely swift pace of hounds now so
much in vogue in England, and is thence, as regards
the hounds and the horses, in unquestionably the most
sportsmanlike condition. It was never intended that
hunting should become steeplechasing; and the unnatural
pace to which hounds are now forced causes them
often to overrun the scent after they have got away;
then, when at fault, the entire ruck of the field have an
opportunity of coming up, to be, of course, once more
distanced, at the repeated sacrifice of the sound principles
of hunting, and to the disadvantage of the true
breed of hunters.</p>

<p>If breeders of horses would give their full attention
to the pursuit, there is no reason why they should not
be as successful in producing the best description of
every class of this animal, as breeders of sheep and
cattle are in their line. By judicious crossing, animals
can be secured with any peculiar characteristics that
may be desired; and for the encouragement of energy
and exertion in this direction, we may remind our
readers that there is now so much competition for the
possession of first-class horses, that our Continental
neighbours constantly outbid us, having learned to
value them even more than we do who have been suffering
our best sires to be bought up and removed
from their native soil to improve the foreign stock. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
is not impossible that, circumstances having directed
so much attention to this subject, good will in this as
in many other cases spring out of evil, and the fostering
of valuable breeds of horses will become a more
widely-recognised source of emolument than it has
been for many years past, regaining, likewise, its proper
standing among Britons as a matter of deep national
interest and importance.</p>

<h3>DISEASES.</h3>

<p>When I had nearly completed this little manual,
chance placed in my way a valuable work called the
‘Illustrated Horse-Doctor,’ by Edward Mayhew,
M.R.C.V.S., which has borne me out in many of my
opinions regarding various diseases, and given me
some useful elucidation as to the latest approved
treatment of some ailments.</p>

<p>I would strenuously recommend the work for its
simplicity and usefulness to country gentlemen and
other owners of valuable horses who can afford to purchase
it; they would derive great assistance from it,
not only as far as regards the written matter, but also
from the spirited and very characteristic illustrations,
exemplifying more clearly than any description possibly
can do, matters connected with the treatment of
horses under disease.</p>

<p>As to this little work, any remedy herein advised to
be used, without reference to competent authorities, is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
practical and may be depended on, though intended to
be harmless in any event.</p>

<p>However, every one must be aware that doctors will
differ, and some who are critics may have pet theories
of their own, which they might here and there prefer
to parts of the practice here recommended.</p>

<p>It may be borne in mind, nevertheless, that diseases,
like politics, with time and occasion are liable to change
their character.</p>

<p>Many diseases are far more easily prevented than
cured; and I must, in the very first instance, protest
against the unnatural and injurious warmth by heated
foul air, so much advocated by grooms, as a means of
giving <i>condition</i>, to produce which, food, work, and air
are the safe and natural agents.</p>

<p>Wherever a means of avoiding any disease herein
touched upon has suggested itself, it is prominently
set forth, in just appreciation of the golden rule, that
“prevention is better than cure.”</p>

<h3>OPERATIONS.</h3>

<p>As all painful operations can now be performed under
the influence of chloroform, the least compensation an
owner can make to his poor beast for the tortures he is
put to, in order to enhance his value and usefulness to
his master, is to lay an injunction on the professional
attendant to make use of this merciful provision, in
cases where severe pain must otherwise be inflicted on
the animal.</p>

<p>Rarey’s method of casting for operations, or when
a horse is so extremely unruly as to require to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
thrown down, may be thus quoted from his own
directions:—</p>

<p>“Everything that we want to teach a horse must be
commenced in some way to give him an idea of what
you want him to do, and then be repeated till he learns
perfectly.</p>

<p>“To make a horse lie down, bend his left fore-leg and
slip a loop over it, so that he cannot get it down. Then
put a surcingle round his body, and fasten one end of
a long strap around the other fore-leg, just above the
hoof. Place the other end under the surcingle so as
to keep the strap in the right direction; take a short
hold of it with your right hand; stand on the left side
of the horse; grasp the bit in your left hand; pull
steadily on the strap with your right; bear against his
shoulder till you cause him to move. As soon as he
lifts his weight, your pulling will raise the other foot,
and he will have to come on his knees.</p>

<p>“Keep the strap tight in your hand, so that he cannot
straighten his leg if he rises up. Hold him in
this position, and turn his head towards you; bear
against his side with your shoulder, not hard, but with
a steady equal pressure, and in about ten minutes he
will be down. As soon as he lies down he will be
completely conquered, and you can handle him at your
pleasure.</p>

<p>“Take off the straps and straighten out his legs; rub
him lightly about the face and neck with your hand
the way the hair lies; handle all his legs, and after he
has lain ten or twenty minutes let him get up again.
After resting him a short time make him lie down and
get up as before. Repeat the operation three or four
times, which will be sufficient for one lesson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p>“Give him two lessons a-day: and when you have
given him four lessons he will lie down by taking hold
of one foot. As soon as he is well broken to lie down
in this way, tap him on the opposite leg with a stick
when you take hold of his foot, and in a few days he
will lie down from the mere motion of the stick.”</p>

<p>For the purpose of handling horses more easily
<i>without casting them</i>, when slight operations have to
be performed, a twitch is used, made by 7 or 8 inches
of cord formed into a noose, which is attached to about
2 feet of a strong stick. The noose is placed on the
upper lip of the horse, and by turning the stick round
and round, it is tightened. The pain thus occasioned
to the animal subdues him to bear almost anything,
and he can thus be subjected to minor operations
while standing, but it is also as well to place a cloth
over his eyes to prevent his being too well informed of
what is going on,—a precaution which may be used
with advantage under various other circumstances, such
as measuring the height, when the sight of the size-measure
as placed against his shoulder might alarm
him;—in fact, upon any occasion when it maybe desirable
that a horse should not be aware of what is
passing around him; for instance, if he is unwilling to
go on board ship or into a horse-van.</p>

<h3>TO GIVE A BALL.</h3>

<p>Turn the animal round in the stall so as to have his
head to the light, making the least possible fuss or
noise.</p>

<p>Stand on a stool on the off side, and, gently putting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
your hand in the mouth, draw the tongue a little out;
place the fingers of the left hand over it, and keep it
firmly in this position by pressure <i>against the jaw</i>—not
holding the tongue by itself, as a restless horse, by
suddenly drawing back or sideways while his tongue is
tightly held, may seriously injure himself.</p>

<p>The ball, having been oiled to cause it to pass easily,
is to be taken between the tips of the fingers of the
right hand, and then, making the hand as small as possible,
pass the ball up the mouth by the roof to avoid
injury from the teeth. Directly the ball is landed well
up on the root of the tongue, take away that hand, and
as soon as it is out of the mouth, let the left hand release
the tongue, which, in the act of being drawn to
its proper place, will help the ball down.</p>

<p>An assistant standing at the near side may be useful
to hand the ball to the operator, and to <i>gently</i> keep the
jaws open while the ball is being given.</p>

<p>Have a warm drink ready to give immediately after
the ball is taken.</p>

<p>It may be remarked that in racing stables, where
such things are generally well done, young and small
boys will, quite alone, coolly take spirited, and often
vicious animals, and in the most gentle manner administer
the ball, unsuspected by the beast himself,
who is hardly made aware of the operation he is undergoing.</p>

<p><i>To give a Drench.</i>—Turn the animal round in his
stall as in administering a ball. Use a cow’s horn, the
wide end having been closed up by a tinman.</p>

<p>Pour in the liquid at the narrow end, the mouth of
which should be an inch in diameter.</p>

<p>The operator, standing on the off side, should have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
an assistant; both should be tall, or make themselves
so by standing on <i>firm</i> stools or a form.</p>

<p>The assistant must raise the horse’s head till his
mouth is above the level of his forehead, and keep it
in that elevated position <i>steadily</i> while the drench is
administered—such position being necessary to facilitate
the passage of the liquid down the throat by its own
gravity, the tongue not being here an available agent,
as with the ball.</p>

<p>The operator, taking the wide end of the horn in his
right hand, can steady and assist himself by holding
the upper jaw with his left, and, leaving the tongue at
liberty, will discharge the drench from the horn <i>below</i>
the root of the tongue if possible.</p>

<p>A proper drenching-horn should be always kept at
hand, and be well cleaned after use.</p>

<p>A glass bottle should never on any account be substituted
for the proper instrument.</p>

<h3>PURGING.</h3>

<p>Whenever an animal accustomed to high feeding and
hard work is from any cause laid by, it is most desirable
(in pursuance of the golden rule that prevention
is better than cure) to take such opportunity to relax
the hitherto tightly-strung bow, by administering a
mild purge.</p>

<p>The object of this precaution is, that the absorbents,
having been accustomed to a perpetual call as the result
of perspiration induced by work, are liable, when the
beast is left at rest for several days, and this call is
thus discontinued, to take on unhealthy action, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
engender diseases, the most fatal of which is that
scourge “Farcy.”</p>

<p>How many a fine horse, to all appearance in the best
condition, have I seen stricken with this fell malady,
from no other accountable cause than that which it is
hereby proposed to guard against; besides, every one
knows that any animal kept at rest and fed up is more
predisposed to all kinds of inflammatory attacks, and
when thus visited the system more readily succumbs.</p>

<p>More than this, every practical man is aware that an
occasional aloetic purge improves the health, condition,
and vigour of a horse.</p>

<p>It seems as if the aloes acted as a powerful tonic and
renovator as well as purge.</p>

<p>What trainer will think of putting a lusty or ill-conditioned
animal into “fettle” without employing this
purge as a partial means?</p>

<p>It is very dangerous to give a purging medicine to
a horse without first preparing the bowels by relaxing
them moderately with bran mashes.</p>

<p>This is best done by giving about three or four
sloppy mashes, three in the course of the day preceding
the administration of the purge (reducing the quantity
of hay to one-third the usual amount), and one the first
thing next morning, no water or hay being given beforehand
that day; about two or three hours after the mash,
administer the purge, giving just before and after it as
much warm water as the beast will drink.</p>

<p>No hay should be allowed this day or night, but as
many sloppy mashes as will be accepted should be
given.</p>

<p>Give two hours’ brisk walking exercise in clothes
about six or eight hours after the administration of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
purge, and next morning, after a mash and watering
(always with warm water), two more hours of the same
exercise in clothes; but be careful <i>not</i> to sweat the
horse.—<a href="#Page_155"><i>See</i> page 155.</a></p>

<p>If the evacuations be fully free, less exercise is necessary;
otherwise, in a couple of hours repeat the walking
at a brisk pace. When the desired effect of the medicine
has been satisfactorily produced, hay and corn may
be <i>gradually</i> resorted to.</p>

<p>While an animal is under the operation of purgative
medicine the water and mashes should be warmed, and
the body well protected from cold by clothing and the
exclusion of draughts.</p>

<p>The ordinary purge, consisting of Barbadoes aloes 4
drachms, extract gentian 2 drachms, is mixed into a
mass by any chemist. With some delicate horses, subject
to looseness, this purge may be too strong, and
should be reduced by a drachm of aloes and half a
drachm of gentian.</p>

<p>On the contrary, with large horses of a full habit, 5
drachms of Barbadoes aloes, or even more, may be necessary,
with 2 drachms of gentian. In all cases where
there is reason to suppose that the mucous surfaces of
the alimentary canal may be in a state of irritation, it
is much safer to give linseed-oil, say a pint at a time,
to which may be added, if speedy purging be essential,
twenty drops of croton oil.</p>

<p>The use of old dry hay will be found the most simple
and ready primary resource to stop purging and steady
the action of the bowels, and a very little bruised oats
may also be given in such cases.</p>

<p>Should the purge appear to gripe, copious clysters of
warm water will afford relief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<h3>THE PULSE</h3>

<p class="noindent">is easily found by placing the two forefingers under the
middle of the horse’s jowl or cheek-bone. The novice
can feel about here till he discovers pulsation, and having
once made himself acquainted with its seat, he will
be the better able to judge of a horse when apparently
out of sorts.</p>

<p>Inside the forearm, and in other spots, the pulse is
equally superficial, but under the edge of the cheek-bone
is the most convenient place to find it, or at the temple.</p>

<p>A horse’s pulse in health beats from about 32 to 38
a minute—the smaller the animal the faster the circulation
will be.</p>

<p>In brain affections the pulse is slower than natural,
it is quickest in inflammation of the serous and fibrous
membranes—much slower in the mucous ones.</p>

<h3>DISEASES OF THE HEAD AND RESPIRATORY ORGANS.</h3>

<p><i>Glanders.</i>—As there is really no cure for this horrible
disease, I will not attempt any dissertation upon it, but,
merely referring to the remarks upon nasal gleet, <a href="#Page_116">page
116</a>, advise all, <i>whenever they have the least suspicion
about the latter</i>, to consult a veterinary surgeon immediately.</p>

<p>The only preventive against the disease is to keep
and work your horses in a reasonable manner, give
them plenty of pure air at all times, and to guard them
as carefully as possible from contagion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p><i>Sore Eyes</i> should be treated mildly by stuping with
tepid water, and the use of laxatives, as mashes, green
food, or a mild purge, according to the severity of the
case. Keep in darkness. If the affection is acute, consult
a professional veterinary surgeon.</p>

<p><i>Common Cold and Influenza.</i>—It should be remembered
that cold air seldom gives cold, but rather its
action upon the exhalent vessels of the skin when they
are under the process of sweat, and when the exercise
that produced the latter has ceased. The superficial
action of a low temperature then proves an astringent,
clogging the small exhalent and exuding vessels, and
by the derangement of the whole animal system, immediately
affects the respiratory organs, producing more or
less fever.</p>

<p>When disease is thus contracted, it is self-evident
that the best way to meet it is by forcing these small
vessels into exudation (or sweat) as rapidly as possible,
which may readily be done by exercise and
clothing upon the very first suspicion that a chill has
been taken, and <i>before the animal is positively affected</i>.
Once, however, that the debility or feverish
symptoms incidental to the disease are manifesting
themselves, active but entirely different measures must
be resorted to.</p>

<p>The premonitory symptoms of cold, and that scourge
of the stud, influenza, are, refusal of corn, staring coat,
dull eyes, at first a thin and soon a purulent discharge
from one or both nostrils, with more or less cough;
pulse wired, sometimes very weak, but if highly inflammatory
symptoms be present, thin and rapid.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, if a professional veterinary
surgeon is procurable, the case should be referred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
to him; but rather than suffer an ordinary farrier to
deal with the animal, I will take the liberty in this, as
in other cases, to offer simple remedies that can do no
harm, and have in my own experience been beneficial.</p>

<p>Bleeding is admissible only in extreme cases, and
under professional advice, at the commencement of an
inflammatory attack, in affections of the brain, or
serous and fibrous membranes—<i>not in mucous ones</i>.
In cases, however, of sudden pulmonary congestion, or
apoplexy of the lungs, general depletion is indicated.
Blood-letting should <i>never</i> be had recourse to in <i>distemper</i>
or <i>influenza</i>,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> neither should purging be thought
of in such cases, as it lowers the system, which, on the
contrary, requires all the sustaining power possible.</p>

<p>Give at once in the most inviting small mash of
bran, or in the form of a ball,—</p>

<div class="ul-container">
<ul>
<li>2 drachms of nitre;</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="noindent">giving little or no hay, and nothing but warm mashes
of bran or linseed, if they will be taken. If the symptoms
are urgent, give in a ball,—</p>

<div class="ul-container">
<ul>
<li>3 drachms of nitre, with</li>
<li>1 drachm of camphor.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Also <i>well hand-rub</i>, with a liniment composed of equal
parts spirits of turpentine and oil mixed, all under the
windpipe, the gullet, within three inches of the ear,
by the parotid glands, and inside the jowls. Use the
liniment twice the first day if the symptoms are severe,
and once each day subsequently—abating its use according
to the disappearance of the disease.</p>

<p>The horse should be placed if possible in a loose-box,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
and being kept warm with plenty of sheets, hoods, and
bandages, the door and window of his stable should
be thrown open during a considerable portion of the
warmer part of the day, to give him <i>plenty of fresh
pure air</i>.</p>

<p>The head should be kept as pendant as possible, in
order to induce the throwing of the nasal discharge,
which will be further assisted by steaming the nostrils,
using a very large nose-bag (if possible of haircloth),
half-filled with common yellow deal sawdust, having
an ounce of spirits of turpentine well mixed through
it; or better, hot bran mashes, of which the poor beast
may be tempted to pick a little when first applied.</p>

<p>Either application must be kept at a high temperature
by the frequent addition of hot water.</p>

<p>The nose-bag must be used several times a day—kept
on for twenty minutes at a time, and never suffered
to remain on the animal till its contents (which
should of course be frequently changed) become cold or
offensive. Or the nostrils may be steamed as well, in
a more simple way, thus:—Fill a bucket full of hay,
stamp it down with the foot, pour <i>boiling</i> water upon
it, renew the boiling water every ten minutes. Let a
man hold the horse’s head in the bucket over the steam
for about half an hour at a time, three or four times
a day.</p>

<p>As recovery progresses, <i>gradually</i> resume ordinary
feeding—remembering that in this, as in all cases of
illness where the constitution has been debilitated, it
has to be carefully rebuilt by food and suitable exercise
to fit the animal for work. It should be borne in mind
that respiratory diseases appear to be <i>very contagious</i>,
for which reason, if for no other, the patient on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
first outbreak of distemper should be removed away
from the rest of the stud to a loose-box, if practicable;
the stall he leaves should be cleansed, and all his utensils
kept <i>rigidly separate</i>.</p>

<p>White-wash and chloride of lime are useful and simple
as disinfectants.</p>

<p>This disease is more easily prevented than cured, and
horse-owners do well to avoid leaving an animal when
heated, or after exercise, standing unclothed in the cold
or in a chilly draught. Also be careful about transferring
a horse suddenly from total exposure at grass,
or from a healthy airy stable to an ill-ventilated and
crowded one.</p>

<p>Though influenza or distemper are often considered
to be epidemic, contagion should be, as before observed,
most carefully guarded against. Some professional men
hold these two designations to represent distinct diseases.
In influenza the animal becomes speedily attenuated,
and the whole system appears disordered and
debilitated, occasionally with lameness, as if from fever
of the feet.</p>

<p>There is generally one mark which may be permitted
to be peculiar as distinguishing some forms of influenza,
particularly in certain seasons during its prevalence,
which is that of the mucous surfaces assuming a yellow
colour all over the body, and the white of the eye being
also tinged with that hue.</p>

<p>When influenza assumes a serious character, the professional
man must be left to deal with it; but pending
the arrival of such assistance, the treatment here recommended
can do no harm, the primary seat of the
disease being that of the respiratory organ.</p>

<p><i>Laryngitis, Bronchitis, Pleurisy.</i>—I will not attempt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
to enter into descriptions or prescribe separate
modes of treatment for these and other diseases of the
respiratory organs, such delicate distinctions belonging
exclusively to the professional man; but while awaiting
his advice, the treatment recommended for common
cold and influenza can do no harm in any attacks of
the upper air-passages; and when the lungs or cavity
of the chest appear to be affected, that advised as
follows for inflammation of the lungs is equally harmless:—</p>

<p><i>Inflammation of the Lungs</i> or <i>Pneumonia</i> is indicated
by great prostration and high fever, heaving of the
flanks (an evidence of great internal anguish); the legs
are spread out to their fullest extent, as if to prop up
the body and prevent it from falling; the breathing is
difficult, and respiration quick; extremities cold; pulse
quick and hard, like wire to the touch; a look of pain
and wretchedness marks the countenance.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Such symptoms can be safely treated by a professional
man only; but if his services cannot possibly be
procured, rub in a powerful mustard poultice over the
lungs, the seat of which I cannot better describe to the
uninitiated than as situated beneath that portion of a
horse’s surface which would be covered by a saddle if
placed on his belly directly underneath the situation it
would have occupied on his back, the pommel being
close to the fore legs, omitting to blister the portion of
the belly which would be covered by the cantel of the
saddle when reversed, but continuing the blister between
the fore legs to the front of the chest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<p>The hair need not be clipped off before the application
of this poultice. Give every six hours, till the
arrival of the veterinary surgeon, from 30 to 40 grains
of ordinary grey powder mixed and administered in the
form of a ball.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Or, in place of grey powder, give
Fleming’s tincture of aconite, eight drops every hour in
half a pint of cold water, until the arrival of a veterinary
surgeon.</p>

<p>Let the animal have an <i>additional quantity</i> of the
purest air, with an increased supply of clothing, and in
cold weather the temperature should be slightly moderated.
The symptoms of recovery are denoted by gradual
cessation of heaving at the flanks; the extremities
getting warmer; the pulse less quick—softer to feel;
and the animal appearing more lively.</p>

<p>His strength must be kept up after the first day or
two by drenches of gruel, till mashes will be accepted.</p>

<p><i>Cough</i>, as before observed, generally accompanies influenza,
distemper, and common cold, but there are
instances where cough may be present with little or no
fever or other derangement, in which case change of
food from corn to bran or linseed mashes, with a limited
allowance of wetted hay or chaff, may be sufficient to
cure.</p>

<p>As a rule, grooms should understand that when coughing
is heard, they are to give bran or linseed mashes
till further orders; nor should an animal suffering from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
cough be expected to do any but very light work or
exercise (every care being taken to avoid his being
chilled), bran mashes not affording sufficient sustenance
to do heavy work upon.</p>

<p>No person or owner should be satisfied with the state
of his horses’ health while they cough. Linseed mashes
daily (<a href="#Page_23">page 23</a>) will be found excellent to ease and cure
cough, also carrots and green food; but when the cough
is accompanied by fever, or other symptoms of ailment,
treat as for influenza, distemper, cold, or sore throat, as
the indications of derangement may direct you.</p>

<p><i>Nasal Gleet</i> may possibly be occasioned by protracted
irritation of diseased molar teeth; but if persistent,
especially of a thin, ichorous, glairy, or size-like character,
and confined to one nostril, generally the left,
the glands under the jaw being swollen and tender, the
Schneiderian membrane or mucous lining of the nose
having a dull, pale, or leaden hue, it should be looked
on with suspicion, particularly if confined to one nostril,
and more so if the discharge adhere round the rim of
it. Cough is seldom present with glanders.</p>

<p>In such cases consult a veterinary surgeon without a
moment’s delay, and be careful to prevent any part of
your own body, or that of any other person, coming in
contact with such a discharge. It is very probably incipient
glanders of the most insidious and dangerous
character.</p>

<p>To more clearly distinguish the dangerous from the
harmless gleet, it may be remarked that when the discharge
is thick and purulent, yellow, and in full flow,
and without a disposition to adhere to the nostril,
though the most alarming in appearance, it is least to
be apprehended, proceeding naturally from a heavy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
cold in the head, which, however, should of course
meet with immediate attention.—(<a href="#Page_110"><i>See</i> “Cold, Influenza,”
page 110.</a>) For the prevention of nasal gleet,
observe the same precautions as those recommended
against cold, &amp;c. (<a href="#Page_109">page 109</a>), and keep your horses as
much as possible to themselves.</p>

<p>In travelling, horses run great risks, and, of course,
such diseases are less likely to be contracted in first-class
hostelries than in inferior and hack stabling.</p>

<p><i>Poll-Evil</i> is generally occasioned by a bruise on the
head, behind the ears, near the neck, by pressure of the
head-stall, &amp;c. (<a href="#Page_16"><i>see</i> “Haltering,” page 16</a>), when, if great
care be not exercised to cure the sore promptly, sinuses
or cavities will form, eating away into the more important
parts of the adjacent structure. Here, also, unless
an immediate cure be effected by the means directed
for the treatment of sores (<a href="#Page_160"><i>see</i> “Water-dressing,” page
160</a>, and <a href="#Page_158">“Zinc Lotion,” page 158</a>), accompanied with
the removal of the head-stall or any aggravating pressure,
the veterinary surgeon ought to be consulted at
once.</p>

<p>Avoiding the causes will be the best preventive of
this disease.</p>

<p><i>Shivering Fits</i> in general precede or are the commencement
of a feverish attack; therefore, in such cases,
no heating food must be allowed. Substitute hot
mashes, increase the clothing, and administer a febrifuge,
as nitre, 2 drachms, repeated in two hours. Or,
if nitre in the mash will not be accepted, give two
ounces of sweet spirits of nitre in half a pint of cold
water.</p>

<p><i>Shivers</i> in the stable, proceeding from nervous sensibility,
are frequently the result of recent excitement,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
caused by a band, an organ, or other unusual noise, or
even by the sudden entrance of the beast’s own attendant,
the bounding of a cat, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Strangles</i> generally attacks young horses about the
age of maturity, or when first stabled. Debility gradually
possesses them; the throat, and particularly the
parotid glands under the ears, are sore and swelled,
tending to distinguish this disease from ordinary cold
and influenza; a discharge from the nose is also present.
The sooner the suppurative process can be induced in
the throat the better.</p>

<p>For this purpose rub in turpentine and oil (one part
turpentine to two parts oil) once or twice a-day, which,
when the skin becomes tender, must be carefully done
with a sponge.</p>

<p>When the suppuration is ripe, a professional man
should let it out with a knife, and recovery speedily
ensues.</p>

<p>As great debility is attendant on this disease, the
system should be kept up by bruised and scalded corn,
and the appetite tempted in every way by green meats,
minced carrots, &amp;c., if requisite. Plenty of air is also
essential.</p>

<p>It ought to be superfluous to remark that under such
circumstances neither bleeding, purging, nor reducing
means of any kind should be adopted, the bowels being
merely kept open by bran and occasional linseed mashes,
which will assist the mucous surfaces. The chill to be
taken off the drink.</p>

<p><i>Soreness of the Throat</i> frequently accompanies distemper
or cold, and is indicated by want of appetite,
constant endeavour to swallow the saliva, <i>difficulty in
imbibing liquids</i>, which, instead of going down the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
throat, appear to be returned through the nostrils, noisy
gulping, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Rub the throat at once with a mixture of equal parts
turpentine and oil, and keep up the irritation on the
skin.</p>

<p>Administer 2 drachms of nitre once or twice the first
twenty-four hours, the animal being, of course, laid by
from all work, and placed in a loose-box; let him be
fed on bran and linseed mashes, and given green food,
carrots, and anything that will tempt his appetite.</p>

<p>Avoid purging, bleeding, or anything that will lower
the system—a rule to be most particularly observed in
all diseases of the respiratory organs, unless severe inflammation
be present, when a professional man only
can judge to what extent the lowering process may be
necessary.</p>

<p><i>Broken Wind</i> is caused by a large number of the air-cells
of the lungs becoming fused, as it were, into one
large air-cell, thus diminishing the aërating surface,
and rendering the lungs weaker. It is indicated by a
sudden inspiration and a long, almost double, expiration;
the flanks and abdomen are observed to suddenly
fall down, instead of being gradually expanded.</p>

<p>Broken wind is, in fact, emphysema of the lung, and
there is said to be no absolute cure for it; but it may
be alleviated by restricting the animal in hay and water,
and giving the latter only in small quantities, not more
than half-a-pint at a time, and moistening all food.</p>

<p>Take care he does not eat his bed, which he will
make every effort to do. He should have no straw
about him in the day, and be muzzled at night.</p>

<p><i>Lampas</i> does not belong properly to these diseases,
indicating some derangement in the alimentary canal,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
but is here mentioned to guard against a brutal practice
commonly resorted to by farriers as a cure for the
disorder.</p>

<p>The groom complains that his charge is “off his
feed,” and fancies that the palate is swollen more than
usual—the fact being that he never examined it at any
other time; and the farrier proceeds to cure the rejection
of food by searing the poor beast’s mouth with a
red-hot iron, or scarifying it with a knife. The reasonable
treatment of an ailment proceeding from heat or
disorder of the stomach will be to withhold all heating
food, at all events to a great extent, giving occasional
mashes, also tonics and alteratives, the latter to those
of full habit, the former in cases of evident debility.</p>

<h3>DISEASES OF THE DIGESTIVE AND URINARY ORGANS.</h3>

<p><i>Diarrhœa</i> and <i>Dysentery</i>.—The first (diarrhœa, or
mere looseness) is, in the horse, seldom more than a temporary
debility. In many cases it is an effort of nature
to relieve herself, and will probably effect its own cure.</p>

<p>The symptoms require no definition, except that it
may be remarked that they are almost invariably unaccompanied
by pain or any other inconvenience. Rest,
and the use of more astringent food, and leaving a piece
of chalk in the manger (which, with horses subject to
diarrhœa, should never be absent), will in all probability
arrest the attack, which may, to a certain extent, proceed
from a predisposition to acidity.</p>

<p>Animals disposed to this disease should be fed on a
drier description of food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p><i>Dysentery</i> is, on the contrary, a highly dangerous
illness, accompanied with pain.</p>

<p>It mostly commences with excessive purgation, the
evacuations being mere foul water in appearance, and
stinking. The beast will drink greedily; the pulse is
weak; great anguish of body perceptible, the perspiration
breaking out in patches.</p>

<p>On the first appearance of such dangerous symptoms,
procure the assistance of a professional man; but in the
interval the following drench may be given:—</p>

<table class="recipe" summary="A recipe for a treatment">
  <tr>
    <td>Laudanum, 1 oz.</td>
    <td rowspan="2" class="valign">} Mix.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Powdered chalk, ½ oz.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class="center smaller">or,</p>

<table class="recipe" summary="A recipe for a treatment">
  <tr>
    <td>Catechu, powdered, 1 drachm.</td>
    <td rowspan="2" class="valign">} Mix.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Chalk, ½ oz.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class="center smaller">or,</p>

<p class="center smaller">Sulphuric ether and laudanum, of each one ounce.</p>

<p>Also injections of cold linseed-tea. The dose may be
repeated in three or four hours, if medical assistance
does not arrive. As great care is necessary in the diet,
as well as general treatment, after partial recovery,
everything should be done under professional advice.</p>

<p>An attack of dysentery is very likely to be caused by
the existence of some acrid matter in the intestines, or
by an overdose, or too constant use, of aloes.</p>

<p>As with diarrhœa, horses predisposed to dysentery
ought always to have a lump of chalk in the manger,
and constant or over-doses of aloes should be avoided.</p>

<h3>COLIC AND GRIPES.</h3>

<p>As these diseases are sudden, and require prompt
treatment, it is well to have some idea of the kind of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
remedy to be employed, pending the arrival of the veterinary
surgeon. Some animals are peculiarly subject
to them, from a susceptible state of the alimentary canal.
Cold water, taken on an empty stomach, or when a
beast is heated, will cause the malady.</p>

<p>The symptoms are distress, evinced by pawing, lifting
of the fore and hind feet towards the stomach, the
head being turned towards the sides, with a look of
anguish; a cold sweat will sometimes bedew the body.
A desire to lie down may be exhibited, and when on
the ground the animal rolls about in evident agony.
The upper lip is strained upwards from the teeth,
almost closing the nostrils, and the pulse indicates
derangement of the system.</p>

<p>When the true character of the ailment has been ascertained,
it is well to inquire as to the character of the
evacuations. If they are in a lax state, and a cause for
the same can be discovered, of course discontinue it,
and use astringent clysters for the bowels (<a href="#Page_159">page 159</a>).
If there be reason to apprehend that some offending
matter is retained in the alimentary canal, use emollient
laxatives and clysters (<a href="#Page_158">pages 158 and 159</a>). But if
anything like costiveness is present, and other remedies
fail, recourse must be had to that of “back-raking,” a
process which need not be here explained, being well
known to every experienced groom, any one of whom
may safely be intrusted with the operation, the only
necessary precaution being to have rather a small hand
used, and that <i>well</i> lubricated with lard or oil. Let all
the fæcal matter that can be reached be carefully extracted.
Afterwards a warm enema, composed of one
pint of turpentine mixed in two quarts of hot soap-suds,
and a soothing drench of</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<div class="ul-container">
<ul>
<li>1 oz. sulphuric ether,</li>
<li>1 oz. laudanum,</li>
<li>1 pint oil,</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="noindent">will be found efficacious.</p>

<p>In the early stages, “gripes,” as they are called, may
be cured by simply “back-raking,” followed by a drench
of a bottle of ale, warmed and mixed with one ounce
of powdered ginger, and a brisk trot in heavy clothing.</p>

<p>Under highly inflammatory symptoms, the professional
man attending will probably bleed.</p>

<p>To guard against colic, avoid giving cold water when
the beast is heated, or on a fasting stomach. With
horses subject to gripes the water should always be
given with the chill off, if possible, or just previous to
a good grooming or other gentle exercise tending to
circulate internal warmth. Never allow any animal the
opportunity of gorging himself with any kind of food
after the stomach has been weakened by extra-severe
work and long fasting.</p>

<p>For costiveness only give soft bran or linseed mashes,
or green feeding; and see treatment for excessive or
painful costiveness, <a href="#Page_122">page 122</a>.</p>

<h3>DIABETES,</h3>

<p class="noindent">or profuse staling, is unfortunately a common disease,
and is generally attributed to something wrong in the
water, but bad provender may occasion it.</p>

<p>Thirst is generally very great.</p>

<p>Give catechu, 2 drachms at a time, two or three times
daily, in mashes.</p>

<p>Change the food or water, whichever on examination<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
seems most objectionable. Give no hay or grass, but
plenty of linseed tea to drink; give <i>good</i> bruised or
scalded oats, with a small quantity of warm bran mixed
in each feed, and leave a lump of chalk in manger: or
administer diluted phosphoric acid, one ounce to one
pint lukewarm water, twice daily, till the symptoms
abate, then gradually reduce the dose.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>A horse once found to be subject to this disease should
be very carefully fed and watered.</p>

<h3>WORMS</h3>

<p class="noindent">are indicated by a state of the coat called “hide-bound”
and “staring,” with loss of condition and indisposition
to work; by a slimy mucus covering the dung-balls;
also occasionally by the adherence of the parasites round
the anus, and thin evacuation in the fæces.</p>

<p>They cling so pertinaceously to the internals, that
they will eat through the coat of the stomach, and are
never likely to be removed by a single dose of any
medicine. Spirit of turpentine is highly recommended
as a cure, but if given it must be diluted largely—one
part turpentine to four parts oil.</p>

<p>Practical experience of various remedies for worms
justifies me in recommending one to two grains of arsenic
and twenty grains of kamela twice daily (each dose
mixed in a handful of wet bran, and given with oats<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
or other feeding) for eighteen days, and a purge the
nineteenth morning.</p>

<p>The horse may get <i>moderate</i> work during the administration
of the <i>powders</i>.</p>

<p>Common salt is also considered a good remedy:
about a tablespoonful daily mixed with the food.</p>

<p>To guard against these pests, avoid the use of Egyptian
beans; but as “bots” are mostly taken in at grass
by the animal licking off and swallowing their larvæ laid
in the hair of the legs, it is almost impossible to exclude
them. In a few cases they are bred in the internals
without any accountable cause, and against this
no precaution can avail.</p>

<p><i>Liver Diseases</i>, or the farriers’ “Yellows,” so called
from the fact that such cases are marked by the eyelids,
linings of the nose, and lips when turned up, being
found to be tinged more or less with yellow.</p>

<p>Here mercury must be administered, and aided by subsequent
purging, as is necessary with the human subject.</p>

<p>Thus, give half a drachm to a drachm of calomel
mixed in a little flour, and put in a mash of bran one
evening, and next morning follow it up with the aloes
purge-ball (<a href="#Page_108">page 108</a>).</p>

<p>If the “yellows” be very marked, with other derangement
of the system, give for two days one drachm
of calomel daily in doses of half a drachm each, mixed
in mashes as described above; and after two drachms
have been taken in this way, administer on the third
morning the aloetic purge.</p>

<p><i>Inflammation of the Kidneys and Bladder.</i>—With
regard to internal inflammation arising from various
causes, the symptoms of distress bear a general resemblance
to each other: legs spread out, extremities cold,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
breathing accelerated, and a look of pain pervading the
animal’s whole appearance, except that in diseases of
the urinary organs there is generally a straddling gait;
and on observance of the genitals, some marked action in
this region on the part of the beast will be discovered.</p>

<p>Such attacks can only be properly treated by a professional
man, therefore lose no time in procuring his
services; but, in the meanwhile, I shall observe that
inflammation of the kidneys is, sad to say, too common
to admit of its being passed by without offering some
caution and advice regarding it, more for the purpose
of prevention than cure.</p>

<p>Disease of the kidneys is generally brought on by the
<i>misuse</i> by grooms of their favourite diuretics; a dose of
nitre to “fine his legs,” or “bloom his coat,” or for any
other purpose to save themselves trouble, is the groom’s
specific for the poor creatures under their care; but so
injurious are diuretics that masters ought to make their
secret administration, as commonly practised by the class
referred to, a case of instant dismissal.</p>

<p>The kidneys of the horse are peculiarly susceptible of
action; so much so, that purges frequently, in place of
acting as intended, will take effect on them.</p>

<p>It should, besides, be borne in mind that while the
kidneys are in artificial action and secreting an extra
quantity of urine which is being passed away, the creature
should have the same opportunity of rest, and as
much consideration given him, as if he were in a state
of purgation. The secretion is blood in its changed
form, and is a serious call on the system. All this does
not enter into the head of an ignorant groom, who, on
the contrary, will work or treat the poor suffering creature
as if he was in his best vigour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>Inflammation of the kidneys is marked by an appearance
of general distress—hind legs straddled, the backbone
hogged, urine small in quantity, tenderness over
the loins when pressed.</p>

<p>If a practitioner be not procurable, immediately place
warm mustard poultices over the loins, and cover them
with sheepskins.</p>

<p>Give half a drachm extract of belladonna with half
an ounce laudanum in a pint of linseed tea every four
hours, and inject constantly with warm linseed tea.</p>

<p><i>Inflammation of the Bladder</i> presents very similar
symptoms to that of the kidneys, only that the bladder
being farther away from the backbone, instead of the
latter being hogged, it is rather depressed. In this case,
as in inflammation of the kidneys, call in the veterinary
surgeon; meanwhile give the drink recommended
for the kidneys, and though the surgeon’s decision is
desirable with regard to mustard blistering, the use of
this counter-irritant should not be too long delayed;
therefore, in the event of his non-arrival within an hour
or so, apply mustard blister to the stomach far back (between
the flanks), as being nearest the seat of this disease.</p>

<h3>DISEASES OF THE FEET AND LEGS.</h3>

<p>Once more the old proverb that “prevention is better
than cure” deserves to be dwelt upon, for very many
diseases under this head can be prevented, and very few
can ever be cured.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the fore feet and hocks of a horse
are the most susceptible of disease induced by wear
and tear—the fore feet, because the greater part of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
weight of the animal is borne upon them; and the hocks
behind, because they are the propelling power.</p>

<p>It is remarkable in cases of lameness, that when the
disease is seated in the feet, the lameness becomes temporarily
aggravated on work; whereas if it proceed from
disease in the legs, it becomes apparently less after
the limbs have been worked a while. With regard to
animals keeping their condition while labouring under
lameness, experience has taught me that horses lame in
the fore feet will, if able to work at all, continue to do
so without apparently losing condition from the fret of
lameness; but when the hind legs are the seat of disease,
the condition evaporates very rapidly. This, I
imagine, is because an animal lame in the fore feet will
lie down and take more rest than when sound; whereas
if lame behind, he will not take sufficient rest, as rising
and lying down cause him pain; hence he continually
stands, and, of course, aggravates the disease.</p>

<img src="images/fig2.jpg" width="400" height="350" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>—Section of Foot.</p>
</div>

<p>The foot is thus sectionised and described by Delaware
P. Elaine, Esq.:—</p>

<p>“On examining a perpendicular section of the foot
and pasterns, there appear the coffin-bone (<i>a</i>), the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
navicular or nut bone (<i>b</i>), the coronary or little pastern
bone (<i>c</i>), the large pastern bone (<i>d</i>), the back sinew or
great flexor tendon of the foot (<i>e</i>), the same tendon
sliding over the navicular bone (<i>f</i>), its termination or
insertion into the bottom of the coffin-bone (<i>g</i>), the
elastic matter of the sensible frog (<i>h</i>), the insensible or
horny frog (<i>i</i>), the horny sole (<i>k</i>), which includes the
parts of the sensible foot; the outer wall of the hoof
(<i>l</i>), the elastic processes (<i>m</i>), the attachment of the extensor
tendon to the coffin-bone (<i>n</i>), and its attachment
to the coronary bone (<i>o</i>), which completes the section.</p>

<p>“The coffin-bone (<i>a</i>) adapts itself to the figure of the
hoof, or rather is adapted by nature to this eligible
form. The eminence in its front receives the insertion
of the tendon of the great extensor muscle of the foot.
This important muscle has its upper attachment to the
humerus or arm-bone, where it is principally fleshy;
but as it passes downwards it becomes tendinous, expanding
over every joint, both to prevent friction and
to embrace and give firm attachment to each bone with
its opposed bone, by which a firm connection of the
various parts is maintained, and a simultaneous movement
of the whole limb is effected. In the hinder
limb this extensor tendon and its two less or tendinous
adjuncts arise from the tibia, and in part from the
femur, but in their origin are fleshy.</p>

<p>“In the sides of the coffin-bone are attached lateral
cartilages, and around its surface are marks of the attachment
of the laminated substance.</p>

<p>“The coronary, or small pastern bone (<i>c</i>), is seen to
rest on the coffin-bone (<i>a</i>), with which it articulates by
its lower end; its posterior part also may be seen to
be closely articulated both with the coffin and with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
navicular or nut bones (<i>f</i>), whose attachments to them
are effected by ligaments of great power and some elasticity.
Nor is it possible to view this horny box and
its contents without being struck with the admirable
display of mechanism and contrivance which meets our
eye. We are apt to say, ‘as strong as a horse,’ and
some of us use horses as though they were made of
imperishable stuff; but surely, when we well consider
the subject, we shall see both the necessity and the
morality of using them with discretion.”</p>

<p>This description of the structure of the foot will probably
better enable the uninitiated to understand the
seat and nature of various ailments of that part of the
horse which are here touched upon.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="fig3">
<img src="images/fig3.jpg" width="400" height="270" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Blaine further describes the construction of the hoof
thus:—</p>

<p>“The hoof itself is conical, or rather, as Clark observes,
slightly truncated, and is a secretion as well from the
vascular parts of the foot as from the skin, as our nails
are formed from the portion of skin called quick. The
structure of the hoof is firm and fibrous. Externally
it is plane and convex, but internally concave and
laminated. The quarters are the lateral parts. As the
horn approaches the heels it becomes soft and is reflected
inwards. The heels are parted by the horny<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
frog (<i>b</i>, fig. 3); and without, the frog on each side the
hoof inflects its fibres to form the bars which are seen
on the under surface (<i>c</i>, fig. 4). In a healthy foot, fig.
4, the heels are round, wide, and smooth (<i>a</i>, <i>a</i>), the frog
fully expanded, the bars or binders distinct (<i>c</i>, <i>c</i>), no
corns in the usual angle (<i>d</i>), the sole broad and concave
(<i>d</i>). In a diseased foot, fig. 3, the heels are high, and
drawn together by contraction (<i>a</i>, <i>a</i>), the frog narrow,
and filled with fissures from contraction and thrush (<i>b</i>),
corn frequently present (<i>d</i>), the sole greatly shortened
in its transverse diameter, which is morbidly counterbalanced
by the increased heights in the truncated form
(<i>c</i>). When the hoof is removed, the sensible or fleshy
sole (<i>h</i>, section of foot), above which it immediately lies,
presents itself, covering the whole of the horny sole,
except so much as is taken up by the sensible frog (<i>h</i>).
This part is exquisitely sensible and vascular, and thus
we learn why injuries to it from puncture produce such
serious effect, and why very slight pressure from contraction
of the hoof gives so much pain. The sensible
frog and the sensible sole form the insensible frog and
sole; but when from pressure, too much moisture, or
other causes, the sensible frog, instead of forming horn,
secretes pus or matter as in thrush, the structure of the
whole becomes injured, and the frog, thus losing its
support, gradually wastes and decays. It is therefore
evident that no thrush can be entirely harmless, as is
erroneously supposed.</p>

<p>“Above the sensible frog is the great flexor tendon,
or back sinew, inserting itself into the vaulted arch of
the coffin (<i>a</i>, section of foot). This important tendon,
arising from its parent muscle above the knee, whose
origin is taken from the humerus and ulna, in its passage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
unites with an assistant flexor, but which latter is
principally distributed to the pastern bones, while the
perforans, so called because it is perforated by the assistant
flexor tendon, is inserted into <i>the vault</i> of the
coffin; in the posterior extremities the attachments of
these two leading flexors and a smaller <i>lateral</i> one are
from the femur and tibia.</p>

<p>“<i>The Sensible Laminæ.</i>—Around the surface of the
coffin-bone, it has been noticed that there are linear
indentations to which about five hundred fibro-cartilaginous
leaves are attached. Each of these is received
between two of the horny lamellæ, which line the interior
of the horny hoof; and when it is considered
what a vast surface of attachment is formed by these
means, the strength of the union will not be wondered
at. No common violence can separate these parts, and
their use as a spring (for they are extensile) to support
the action of an animal at once weighty, strong, and
extremely agile, must be apparent.</p>

<p>“The vessels and nerves of the foot are derived from
the metacarpal arteries, veins, and nerves, which pass
behind the pastern, when the main trunks divide to
proceed to each side of the foot, and are ramified from
thence throughout. It is a division of the metacarpal
nerve on each side of the lesser pastern, or on each side
of the larger, as occasion suits, which forms the nerve
operation now in vogue as a remedy (?) for navicular
disease.”</p>

<p><i>Laminitis</i>, or <i>Fever of the Feet</i>, although generally
the result of too long a journey, or any exercise where
excessive and continuous concussion has been occasioned
to the feet, frequently arises from other causes.
It is often what is termed secondary, as one of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
sequelæ of inflammatory diseases of a more constitutional
character.—(<a href="#Page_155"><i>See</i> “Metastasis,” page 155.</a>) The laminæ
are plates (technically, semi-cartilaginous leaves received
between the horny lamellæ which line the interior of
the hoof) resting on the inside of the horny hoof, and
giving an elastic support, whereby the whole weight of
the horse’s structure is thrown against the wall of the
hoof and kept off the side. It is not surprising, therefore,
that these causes should produce derangement here.</p>

<p>As laminitis generally attacks the fore feet, the poor
beast in his anguish endeavours to throw his weight
off them by resting on his hind quarters, which are
tucked under him, with the fore legs and feet pushed
out before him merely to keep him from falling; he
can barely hobble if he attempts to move. If the fever
be only slight and in one foot, he will point it, while
extreme lameness and unnatural heat in the foot mark
the disease. The shoe should (in this as in all cases of
foot-lameness) be instantly removed by a smith brought
to the stable instead of giving the poor creature the
pain of limping to the forge.</p>

<p>The foot should be put into cold water, constantly
renewed, and kept in it all day; at night a bran poultice
or water-dressing should be left on (<a href="#Page_160"><i>see</i> “Water-dressing”
and “Poultices,” page 160</a>). Also administer
a purge.</p>

<p>In acute cases, bleeding at the toe is sometimes practised
by paring away there till the veins appear. This is
a very questionable remedy, and there is little doubt that
the use of the knife only aggravates the inflammation.</p>

<p>The fact is, that beyond its incipient stage none but
the veterinary surgeon is competent to deal with this
disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p>Its prevention is best secured by requiring moderate
work only, and at the proper road-paces—viz., walking
and trotting—keeping the feet moist, wetting them
occasionally during a long journey, and <i>regularly stopping
them directly after each day’s severe work</i>.—<a href="#Page_12"><i>See</i>
“Grooming,” page 12.</a></p>

<p><i>Navicular Disease</i> is, unfortunately, a very common
one with horses; and when the delicate structure of
the foot is considered in connection with the rough
usage the creature gets on hard roads while carrying
a heavy weight on his back, it is only surprising that
the feet bear such jarring at all.</p>

<p>The navicular is the small pulley-bone over which
the flexor tendon passes, and being the most active of
any of the foot-bones, is the most likely to be injured
by ill usage (<a href="#Page_128"><i>see</i> page 128</a>). The symptoms are lameness,
with more or less pointing of the foot when at
rest, and heat towards the quarters of the lame foot.</p>

<p>Unlike laminitis, the lameness is inconsiderable at
first, and increases as the disease progresses.</p>

<p>Being so deep-seated, it is very difficult to cure. In
the incipient stages the most effectual remedy appears
to be the insertion of frog-setons, requiring the assistance
of a veterinary surgeon. In most instances the
case is hopeless, and many a fine horse is sold to limp
out a life of misery, drawing a hack cab, or, with a
refinement of cruelty, is subject to the operation of unnerving
the foot, which, by destroying sensation in that
part, enables the animal to travel without apparent
lameness, though the disease continues to progress till
part of the foot has been known to drop off in work.
Being a result of work to which all horses are liable, no
mode of prevention can be recommended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p><i>Lateral Cartilages.</i>—Another ailment of the foot is
more common than is generally supposed, called “Disease
of the Lateral Cartilages.” It requires the skill of
an anatomist to decide upon its presence. In fact, this
and navicular disease are both very obscure in their
origin and diagnostics, and a surgeon only can properly
deal with them, as well as with all other diseases that
are not very distinctly marked, and in their early stages
not important.</p>

<p><i>Thrush.</i>—A disease of the frog: the cleft becomes
eaten away, and a foul matter is secreted. It more frequently
attacks the hind than the fore feet.</p>

<p>By some it is said to be constitutional, but it is much
more probably the result of neglect of the foot in the
stable, the hind feet being oftener affected, from the
fact of the urine and fæces coming more immediately
under their tread.</p>

<p>At every shoeing or removing, the frog should be
perfectly cleared of all defective parts by the knife, and
where the disease has once manifested itself the cleft
should be kept continually stopped with tar and tow.
A return to a healthy state is likely to be tedious, therefore
continued attention to these directions is necessary.
If a severe case, use a bar-shoe, to avoid the wear and
tear of the road, and which will also help to keep the
pledgets of tar and tow in their place. To prevent
thrush, let the litter and bedding be completely removed
from the horse every morning till bedtime at
night; let the pavement be kept scrupulously clean
through the day; attend and wash the feet, examine
them frequently, and upon the slightest sign of the disease
use the remedial means.</p>

<p><i>Quittor.</i>—This is a disease of the feet, wherein, either<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
from delicacy of or accident to the sole, the sensible
part becomes affected. A suppurative sinus is formed,
eating away till it often comes out at the coronet. Once
it reaches this, the animal, unless of great value, might
as well be destroyed, the restorative process being of a
most tedious and expensive character, requiring continual
manipulation by a surgeon.</p>

<p>By careful shoeing (where nails are not driven out
of their proper direction) and a most exact examination
of the foot where any extraneous matter, such as glass,
gravel, &amp;c., is suspected of having entered or damaged
it, quittor will most probably be avoided.</p>

<p><i>Canker</i> seldom attacks gentlemen’s horses, or well-bred
ones. It is literally a change of a portion of the
foot into a kind of fungus, sometimes commencing in
the sole, sometimes in the frogs, and is aggravated by
foul litter, bad stabling, and general bad care.</p>

<p>As no dressing or external application will restore
the foot without manipulation, a surgeon only can deal
with it.</p>

<p><i>Cracked and Greasy Heels.</i>—Animals of languid circulation
in the extremities are more susceptible of such
diseases, which are induced and aggravated by lazy
ignorant grooms pursuing their objectionable practice
of wetting the legs, and leaving them to dry themselves.—<a href="#Page_13"><i>See</i>
page 13.</a></p>

<p>Symptoms are tumefaction and soreness of the hinder
part of the pasterns, even to fissures emitting matter.</p>

<p>Clip away the hair in the first instance, so as to be
able to cleanse the sore by washing it with warm water
and soft soap, drying it perfectly. Then apply glycerine
lotion (<a href="#Page_158">page 158</a>).</p>

<p>If the sore seems likely to incapacitate the animal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
from work, administer a mild aloetic purge (<a href="#Page_108">page 108</a>).
Very serious consequences may result from the indolence
of grooms in neglecting this ailment. In acute cases,
the sore, eating into the tendon, produces mortification
and death. I have myself lost a valuable animal from
this disease, through the gross neglect of my grooms in
my absence.</p>

<p>Except in the very earliest stages, and in palpably
trifling cases, a veterinary surgeon should be consulted,
especially in what is called “grease,” or matter running
from these cracks. The preventive means are, never to
allow water to your horses’ legs above the coronet on
any pretence whatever, and if by accident or work they
get wet, to have them rubbed dry as promptly as
possible.</p>

<p><i>Shelly Hoofs</i> (or splitting open of the external part
of the horny hoof).—The feet of some horses are more
subject to this disease than those of others, from the
fibrous structure being more dry with them.</p>

<p>This fibrous structure forming the hoof is found, on
microscopic examination, to resemble a lot of hairs all
glued together into a hardened mass, and where the
adhesive matter is of a drier character than usual, the
hoofs are more brittle. With some horses this results
in “shelly hoofs;” they don’t split, but are perpetually
breaking away. With this description of hoofs, tar is
the best possible application. Neither grease nor oil
should ever be used—these only aggravate the disease,
as on close observation they will be found to act as
powerful astringents, excluding the healthy action of
air and moisture upon the part most in need of them.
Strange to say, tar, from its pungent properties, induces
healthy action in the part, and is peculiarly adapted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
to promote the growth of the fibrous structure as well
as lubricating it.</p>

<p><i>Sand-Cracks</i> seldom go diagonally, but are either
horizontal or vertical. I shall endeavour to exemplify
the simple principle of this disease with a simple principle
of remedy, dealing with it like a split in a board
on which I desired to put an effectual stopper. In such
a case I should carefully gouge out a small hole at each
end of the split, beyond which hole the fissure would be
certain not to pass. With the hoof the same principle
can be carried out by filing an indentation directly
across each end of the crack, only taking care not to file
deeper than the insensible part of the hoof; or the end
will be answered by using a red-hot firing-iron instead
of a file, taking the same precaution not to touch the
sensible part. I should also weaken along the edges of
the crack itself by rasping them down. Over the crack,
if deep, should be strapped a thin pad of tow and tar,
to induce reproduction and prevent foreign substances
from entering the fissure.</p>

<p>Unless by the grossest neglect, no sand-crack will
have been allowed to go beyond the reach of the foregoing
treatment, but in some cases the effect of negligence
and ignorance is seen in the horizontal crack
running almost round the foot. In such cases it will
generally be found that with a flat foot (inclined to
greater malformation) the toes have been suffered to
extend, shoeing after shoeing, by the smith allowing
a great accumulation of wall over the toe, until the
centre has become weakened into a fissure. Such a
state of things seldom or never occurs in a gentleman’s
stable, but is to be met with among farm-horses or
those accustomed to heavy draught.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<p>The careful strapping-up with tar and tow, which
must be constantly attended to, rest, and the indentation
process, will, with <i>time</i> and <i>care</i>, effect a cure.</p>

<p>Sand-crack, especially the vertical, is more dangerous
and tedious the nearer it is to the coronet. This once
divided, the case becomes serious, the coronet being
very vascular, and a split here requires a great deal
of care to induce it to take on union. Unless the
closing commences at the coronet, and continues as the
hoof grows <i>down</i>, it will never close <i>at all</i>; in fact, if
the coronet be divided, it is fortunate if the crack does
not go the whole way down to the shoe. If it does
not, the lower end should be weakened by filing an
indentation at its lower extremity, weakening the sides
of the crack by rasping them, and keeping the hoof
strapped round with dressings of tar and tow, also (a
most <i>important</i> part of the treatment) paring away the
wall of the foot (above the shoe and immediately under
the crack) an inch—that is, half an inch on each side
of it—making as large a vacuum as can with safety to
the sensible parts of the foot be pared away, directly
under the crack and over the shoe; the object of this
being that all parts of the wall except that under
the crack shall press on the shoe. It is obvious that
by the above means every movement of the horse, in
place of aggravation, will tend towards alleviation of
the disease, by pressing the weakened sides of the
fissure together. For the foregoing reasons, in the case
of a vertical crack the shoes had better remain on,
while in the worst cases of the horizontal crack, as its
weight round the bottom tends to weaken the centre of
the hoof where the crack is likely to be situated, it had
better be removed (or light tips worn), its absence also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
enabling the wall of the hoof under the crack to be
rasped as thin as possible. In vertical cracks the use
of a bar-shoe will tend to keep the foot together (<a href="#Page_81">page
81</a>).</p>

<p><i>Corns</i> are occasioned by the inflexible shoe pressing
on that part of the sole, or possibly from friction of
the bones upon its internal surface. They present the
appearance of a red effused bruise, almost invariably
situated on the heel of the sole of the inside quarter of
the fore feet.—<a href="#fig3"><i>See</i> illustration, fig. 3, page 130.</a></p>

<p>When neglected, they occasion severe lameness, and
go on to suppuration.</p>

<p>Broken knees are also frequently the result of neglected
corns.</p>

<p>A horse that is habitually properly shod is never
likely to have a corn. It arises entirely from want of
attention and judgment in the smith. The groom,
who should always stand by when a horse is shoeing,
ought to be instructed to see that the farrier with his
drawing-knife invariably pares out the sole at the
seat of corn; it can be no injury whatever to the foot
when properly done, and is the best preventive of
corns. Also take proper care that the shoes are so
put on that they cannot by possibility press upon the
sole.</p>

<p>For prevention, keep the seat of corn well pared
away, and dress with tar, unless in the suppurating
state, when it requires poultices (<a href="#Page_160">page 160</a>), and the
ordinary treatment for that state, and full rest.</p>

<p><i>Over-reach</i> or <i>Tread</i> proceeds from the shoe of one
foot coming in contact with the soft or sensible part
above the hoof of the other. As the parts likely to
be affected round the coronet are full of vessels, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
simplest remedial means are the safest—viz., water-dressing
(<a href="#Page_160">page 160</a>) in the first instance, and afterwards
chloride of zinc lotion (one grain to the ounce of water),
or glycerine.</p>

<p><i>Broken Knees.</i>—Most travellers on the road know
what style of thing this is, so it is needless to describe
it.</p>

<p>In bad cases, where the bones are exposed, and there
is any appearance of synovia or joint-oil, place the
horse in the nearest convenient stable, and leave him
there to be attended to by a professional man as soon
as possible. When the abrasion is merely superficial,
take the animal quietly to his stable, if near.</p>

<p>In any event, wash the wound with warm water,
which, if it be at all deep, should be done by squeezing
the water <i>above</i> the wound, and allowing it to run
down, as this part of the leg is very delicate and sensitive,
and rough handling with a cloth or sponge should
be avoided.</p>

<p>Afterwards apply a lotion of chloride of zinc, one
grain to the ounce of water.</p>

<p>Tie the creature’s head up in such a way as that he
cannot possibly lie down, until the healing process has
assumed sufficient health to render it safe to allow of
the knee being used in lying down and getting up.</p>

<p>Give one or two mild purges, according to the time
he is laid up and the healthiness of the wound. To
promote the growth of hair, use, when the knee is perfectly
healed, hog’s lard mixed with very finely powdered
burnt leather to colour it; it is as good and safe
a thing as can be employed for the purpose. Otherwise
use <i>weak</i> mercurial ointment. For prevention, avoid
the use of bearing-reins in harness; in shafts, keep the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
weight off your horse’s back; keep out of the way of
ruts and stones upon the road, and be very careful of
your beast when the work you are giving him is calculated
to make him leg-weary.</p>

<p>In riding, teach your bearer to depend on himself,
<i>not</i> on you: at the same time, don’t leave him to himself
altogether. Go gently round sharp turns, and don’t
ride fast down-hill on the road, though on the turf or
in harness the pace may be accelerated with impunity.
Avoid inflicting sudden, injudicious, and undeserved
chastisement; restrain starts or alarms; have your
horses properly prepared in frosty weather; also be
sure that the seat of corn is kept well pared out in
shoeing. If your saddle has shifted forward out of its
place, dismount and regirth it where it fits, so that
when you remount your weight will be properly placed
away from the shoulders.</p>

<p>When the road is the only place available to have
your horses exercised, see that your grooms put on the
knee-caps.</p>

<p><i>Splints</i> are a well-known affection of the fore leg,
presenting the appearance of a bony protrusion along
the canon or shank, which, though unsightly, is not
very important, unless when lameness ensues.</p>

<p>As it is not my intention to enter into professional
technicalities in this work, I shall merely remark that,
by letting the horse continue in moderate work, though
lame, with the application of Stevens’s ointment, according
to the directions accompanying it, absorption of the
bony matter will be obtained, or, at all events, it will
become so far resolved that the surrounding structures
being able to accommodate themselves to what remains
of it, their action will not be interfered with, and lameness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
will consequently no longer appear. Veterinarians
sometimes perform a simple operation for splints which
is said to be efficacious—namely, that of dividing the
periosteum with a bistuary, the periosteum being that
membrane which encases all bones like a skin. When
this is cleverly done, there is little or no disfiguration
left. Setons also are sometimes run over the exostosis
or bony excrescence, but I deal only with simple remedies.
As splints cannot be prevented, being a common
result of work in young horses, the next best thing to be
done is to resolve them while in an incipient state.</p>

<p><i>Clap of the Back Sinew</i>—<i>i.e.</i>, inflammation of the
sheath under which the flexor tendon passes (as the
most able practitioners deny that the tendon itself can
be stretched, though it is liable to rupture about its
insertions)—is best treated, according to some, by cold
refrigerant lotions, Goulard lotion, solution of acetate
of lead, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I prefer plain water-dressing (<a href="#Page_160">page 160</a>) placed loosely
round the affected part of the leg, and the use of a
high-heeled shoe (<a href="#Page_82">page 82</a>). When the attack is beyond
the reach of such mild treatment, the veterinary
surgeon will probably advise blistering and firing to act
as a perpetual bandage.</p>

<p>Moderate work on even surfaces will be the best preventive
of this disease, and having the pavement of
your stables made nearly level, as described under the
head of “Stabling” (<a href="#Page_8">page 8</a>).</p>

<p><i>Wind-Galls</i> are undue distensions of the bursæ or
bags of synovia at the back and sides of the lower part
of the canon or shin intended to lubricate the adjacent
structure. Though unsightly, and no improvement to
the action of the horse, they can be reduced by external<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
absorbents (<a href="#Page_159">page 159</a>), also by bandages with refrigerant
repellants, such as vinegar and water (<a href="#Page_12"><i>see</i> “Grooming,”
page 12</a>).</p>

<p><i>Riding-Bone</i> is an unhealthy enlargement round the
pastern above the coronet, generally in front, and may
be removed in the incipient stage by external absorbents
(<a href="#Page_159">page 159</a>), beyond which a professional man had better
be consulted.</p>

<p><i>Wrench</i> or <i>Wrick</i>, occasioned by accident or strain in
work over a rough path by a slip, presents generally
no external swelling or indication of suffering beyond
lameness in movement; but on close examination, inflammation
will be discovered by extra heat about the
part affected. Remove the shoe, give plenty of rest,
and apply water-dressing (<a href="#Page_160">page 160</a>) round the affected
part. A purge may be administered, as recommended
in all cases where the animal is laid up for several days.
To avoid wrench, care should be observed in starting,
turning, and working a horse, especially on uneven
ground or when heavily laden.</p>

<p><i>Mallenders</i> and <i>Sallenders</i> denote a scurvy state of
the skin inside the bend of the knees and hocks. Let
the parts be cleansed with hot water and soft soap, and
rub in equal parts of hog’s lard and mercurial ointment
mixed; if there be a positive crack or sore, use the
chloride of zinc lotion (<a href="#Page_158"><i>see</i> page 158</a>) till healed. Keep
a good attentive groom, and see that he does his work,
as such blemishes are occasioned by carelessness and
want of cleanliness.</p>

<p><i>Spavin</i> is like splint, a bony excrescence, but on the
lower part of the leg, at the inside of the <i>hock</i> towards
the front, occasioned by local derangement from overwork
of the structure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<p>If it does not produce lameness it had better be left
alone; but otherwise, the horse being placed in a loose-box,
rest should be given, and treatment with absorbents
(<a href="#Page_159">page 159</a>), the use of Stevens’s ointment, &amp;c.,
persisted in. A mild purge or two during the process
will be beneficial.</p>

<p>As in nearly all affections of the legs and feet, proper
reasonable work and due care will avert the disease or
disfigurement.</p>

<p><i>Curb</i> is an enlargement of the tendon or its sheath
at the lower part of the back of the hock, with a good
deal of local inflammation attending it.</p>

<p>It is greatly occasioned by the fashion some riders
have of habitually throwing their horses back on their
hocks by severe use of the bit.</p>

<p>Use water-dressing to reduce inflammation, then absorbents,
such as Stevens’s ointment (<a href="#Page_159">page 159</a>). Give
rest, &amp;c., as directed for Spavin.</p>

<p><i>String-Halt</i> is a well-known and only too conspicuous
defect or affection of the nerves of the hind limbs, or
emanating from the spine.</p>

<p>As its local origin is obscure, so also is the method
of dealing with it.</p>

<p>It is in no way dangerous, though unsightly, and
seriously deteriorating to the value of the animal, although
it is said not to interfere much with his working
powers.</p>

<p><i>Capped Hock</i> is a pursy swelling over the <i>os calcis</i>
or heel-bone at the end of the hock, generally produced
by kicking either in the stable or against some object
in harness, or possibly in consequence of exertion in
getting up and lying down on a scanty bed, especially
where the paving-stones are uneven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>Use hot fomentations, loose water-dressing, followed
by rubbing in iodine ointment, if necessary, for reduction,
but this must be done with judgment and
careful observance of the effect the iodine produces.
Or, after using hot fomentations for a week, apply gas
water (which can be obtained from any gas-works)
with a sponge dabbed on every hour during the day.
This treatment, if persisted in, is said to be very efficacious.</p>

<p>For prevention, keep a good bed for your horse to lie
on at night. See “Kicking in the Stable” (<a href="#Page_85">page 85</a>)
and “Kicking-Strap” (<a href="#Page_58">page 58</a>).</p>

<p><i>Thorough-Pin</i> and <i>Bog-Spavin</i> are, like wind-galls,
an undue distension of the bursæ containing the
synovia intended to keep the surrounding parts of the
leg lubricated; such distension interfering with the
circulation of the vein in front of the hock is denominated
“Blood” (or Bog) Spavin; at the back
and sides of the hock these distensions are called
Thorough-Pin.</p>

<p>The treatment is with hot fomentations and gas
water, as in “capped hock,” or other absorbents, especially
Stevens’s ointment, iodine ointment, blisters, and
actual cautery, which remedies had better be tried in
rotation, the three latter only by a practitioner; but
unless the distensions produce lameness, it is perhaps
preferable not to meddle with them at all.</p>

<p>There are other diseases of the feet and legs, but
requiring very delicate definitions: they must be left
altogether to the professional man.</p>

<p>As a rule, in all cases where it may be considered
desirable to use stimulating or strong absorbing treatment
externally to cure lameness, the inflammation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
should be first fully abated by <i>local</i> cooling applications;
and in severe cases, purges administered before
the application of blisters or powerful absorbents.</p>

<h3>FARCY.</h3>

<p>This dreaded disease is, I believe, like glanders, incurable,
and generally ends in glanders itself.</p>

<p>Some practitioners seem to be under the impression
that it only attacks worn-out and ill-conditioned animals;
but from personal losses and sad experience I
may venture to differ entirely from such an opinion,
and to state that I have seen horses in the finest condition
lost by it. No doubt feeble animals are very
liable to it, but the disease is not confined to such constitutions.
I have remarked that, when contracted by
high-conditioned horses, it can be traced to their being
called on occasionally to do extra work, followed by
entire rest for days together, as a sort of equivalent for
the spurt of work done, during which period of rest
(considered necessary on account of the beast’s supposed
state of exhaustion) his powers are taxed with the
same amount of high feeding as if he were in full work.</p>

<p>Thus the absorbent system seems to become diseased,
and farcy-buds appear, accompanied by craving thirst,
in which case, or on the least suspicion of the disease,
reference should at once be made to a professional man.</p>

<p>From these buds (whence after a time matter is seen
to exude) small cords may be traced leading to other
swellings, rather serving to distinguish the early stages
of farcy from surfeit, besides that in surfeit the lumps
appear indolent and scabby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span></p>

<p>To guard against this scourge of the stable, as the
disease is contagious, be careful what company your
horses keep, and let reason be used in the working,
feeding, exercising, and general care of your stud.</p>

<p>What is called <i>Water Farcy</i> is neither dangerous
nor contagious, and arises from debility of the system,
occasioned probably by overwork and indifferent
feeding.</p>

<p>It is generally marked by a dropsical swelling of the
legs, mostly the hind ones. It is not common in gentlemen’s
stables, where horses are less worked and better
cared for than their neighbours.</p>

<p>The best cure is friction to the swelling, moderate
work, and improved feeding; and give a ball twice
a-day, each dose with</p>

<p>The animal should be thrown up from work during
this treatment, which may be requisite for a month, and
good food given.</p>

<p>Administer also a powerful alterative or two during
the course of treatment, more particularly if the case is
obstinate.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Other practitioners recommend, with the administration
of alteratives, the simple application of a solution
of nitrate of silver, 30 grains to 1 ounce of water (distilled),
applied every second day to the eruptions, until
they are destroyed.</p>

<h3>SURFEIT</h3>

<p class="noindent">is an eruption on the skin, and generally gives way, if
attended to immediately on its appearance, by relaxing
the bowels mildly, giving partly green food instead of
hay and bran mashes; at the same time keep up the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
strength by feeding with the best oats and a little beans,
alternately with the laxative treatment.</p>

<p>Should these means not suffice, or the disease become
worse, consult a medical practitioner, who will probably
administer diuretics; or if you cannot procure a professional
man, give the following excellent tonic and alterative
drink, recommended by Mr Mayhew:—</p>

<table class="recipe" summary="A recipe for a treatment">
  <tr>
    <td>Liquor arsenicalis,</td>
    <td>1 ounce.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Water,</td>
    <td>1 quart.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class="center smaller">Mix, and give daily half a pint for a dose.</p>

<p><i>Hidebound</i> requires the same treatment as surfeit.</p>

<p><i>Mange</i> is generally the result of insufficient food and
other privations endured at grass, and of the neglect of
the skin consequent on animals being turned out for a
time to take care of themselves.</p>

<p>It is highly contagious, and is now admitted to be
occasioned by an insect which is engendered in the foul
coat.</p>

<p>A capital wash is recommended by Mr Mayhew,
viz.:—</p>

<table class="recipe" summary="A recipe for a treatment">
  <tr>
    <td>Animal glycerine,</td>
    <td>four parts.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Creosote,</td>
    <td>half a part.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Oil of turpentine,</td>
    <td>one part.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Oil of juniper,</td>
    <td>half a part.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>About a pint and a half is said to be the quantity
required to make one dressing. Every portion of the
entire coat should be saturated with this wash, and thus
left for two clear days, when it should be washed
clean with soft soap and warm water, equal care being
taken to omit no part of the body, which should afterwards
be thoroughly dried and the coat well dressed or
whisked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>

<p>When all is dry and clean apply a second dressing,
proceeding as directed for the first, and a third after the
two days have elapsed and the second cleaning process
has been thoroughly gone through, after which the disease
ought to be eradicated. A mere disposition to
scratching is generally successfully treated by giving
bran mashes night and morning for some days, and
part green food instead of hay. Others recommend for
mange, as most successful, the following application, to
be well rubbed in once a-week all over the animal with
a stiff horse-brush:—</p>

<table class="recipe" summary="A recipe for a treatment">

<p>The whole of the horse’s body to be thoroughly washed

<h3>SORE BACK, WITHERS, AND SITFASTS,</h3>

<p class="noindent">should be carefully attended to with poultices or water-dressing
(<a href="#Page_160"><i>see</i> page 160</a>), while a disposition to throw off
pus is present, after which the application of healing
agents (among which chloride of zinc lotion and glycerine
are now prominent) is the proper course, but applicable
only to decidedly trifling and superficial cases. It
is imperative, if a cure be desired, that no pressure
whatever from the saddle or any other cause of irritation
be permitted; therefore, unless a saddler can
effectually chamber and pack the saddle so as to prevent
the possibility of its touching on or near the sore, the
saddle must not be used at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<p>The worst and common result of sores on the back is,
that sinuses or cavities, with an almost imperceptible
orifice, insidiously eat away like poll-evil into the more
important part of the adjacent structure. Here the aid
of the veterinary surgeon is indispensable.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>(Being myself acquainted with anatomy, I used to get a depending
orifice as near as possible to the bottom of the sinus (as discovered
with a probe) by a bistuary, laying the sinus open all the
way; or if the direction were rather superficial, by the insertion of
a seton-needle about the width of the sinus, run out at bottom,
leaving the seton in to direct the discharge. The latter operation,
if carefully conducted, is decidedly the simplest and best when practicable.)</p>

</div>

<p>For prevention of sore back avoid injurious pressure
from an ill-fitting saddle; also removing it too quickly
from, the back of a heated animal (<a href="#Page_37"><i>see</i> “Work,” page
37</a>). Pressure of the terret-pad (<a href="#Page_59"><i>see</i> page 59</a>), or of the
roller from not being properly chambered over the ridge
of the back (<a href="#Page_19"><i>see</i> page 19</a>), must also be carefully guarded
against.</p>

<h3>WOUNDS,</h3>

<p class="noindent">if deep or dangerous, should meet with the immediate
attention of a surgeon, as none but anatomists should
deal with them. Generally speaking, the loss of a moderate
quantity of blood is rather beneficial than otherwise,
tending to avert inflammation. Where water-dressing
(<a href="#Page_160"><i>see</i> page 160</a>) can be applied, nothing is better
in the first instance; and when the wound is fairly
cleansed and evidently healing, the chloride of zinc
lotion (<a href="#Page_158"><i>see</i> page 158</a>) will advance that process and help
to dry it up. When the surface is <i>perfectly</i> healed and
a new skin formed, the growth of the hair will be promoted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
by the application of hog’s lard coloured with
very finely powdered burnt leather.</p>

<h3>MEGRIMS OR EPILEPSY</h3>

<p class="noindent">may proceed from the effects of the sun in very hot
weather, from congestion of the blood-vessels of the
brain and head, or from disordered stomach or indigestion.
The horse when at work suddenly evinces a disinclination
to proceed, appears bothered, and shows unaccountable
perverseness—sometimes staggers and falls.
Release him at once from whatever work he may be at;
if the cause can be descried, treat in the most reasonable
way accordingly. If the illness is supposed to
proceed from the heat of the sun or congestion of the
head, dash water on the head and keep it enveloped in
cold wet cloths; also cool the system by aperients, giving
rest for some time. If from indigestion, repeated
mild aperients should be administered.</p>

<p>It is a strange fact known to those who are experienced
on the road, that these fits are seldom or never
taken during work at night. When such attacks are
habitual the animal is only fit for farm-work.</p>

<h3>CRIB-BITING AND WIND-SUCKING.</h3>

<p>Some able veterinarians declare these habits to be
the result of an endeavour to eject acidity from the
stomach as the horse cannot vomit, while others compare
it to the human belch. It is almost impossible to
<i>cure</i> a crib-biter; the only thing that can be done is,
to palliate and prevent it, which is essential, as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
habit is not only injurious to the horse himself, but one
that, strange to say, is most readily imitated by his
companions; in whatever stable such an animal may
be, the others are liable to become crib-biters.</p>

<p>By leaving a lump of rock-salt in horses’ mangers
many ailments may be averted. Licking it is a resource
to them in their hours of solitary confinement.
In the present instance a lump of chalk might be
added, for the animal to amuse himself at any moment
that he is left without a muzzle (which should be made
for him by an experienced saddler, and constantly
used). The chalk being essentially antacid, is decidedly
useful if the habit is supposed to result from acidity.</p>

<p>As the muzzle should not be left off for any length
of time, the food should be prepared to be taken up
in the most rapid form—viz., a small quantity of chaff
to bruised oats. When the beast finds by experience
that his feeding-time is limited, with starvation for the
alternative, he will probably prefer his food to gnawing
the iron during the short space allowed him without
his muzzle. A simple remedy sometimes used with
good effect is, keeping a tightened strap round the
creature’s neck when he is not feeding; and I have
known the covering of every portion of the stall within
his reach with rabbit or sheep skins, the hair outside,
to effectually check a crib-biter for the time being,—the
habit being resumed, however, on his removal to another
stall.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<h3>METASTASIS.</h3>

<p>As this term is frequently used by practitioners, it
may be well to explain that it is a Greek word signifying
a removal from one place to another, employed as
a technical designation in describing a change of the
seat of disease from one part of the animal structure
to another, which is by no means uncommon: for
instance, when the feet are attacked with fever, that
malady will appear to remove itself to some other and
probably distant part, and fix itself on the lungs or
other viscera, the same way that inflammation of the
lungs and other parts of the upper structure will change
amongst themselves, or from their own seat of disease
to the feet.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> I have even known superpurgation (occasioned,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
in a pair of horses, by <i>undue</i>, but not severe
work when under the irritation of the medicine) to
cause fever of the feet, by a metastasis, changing the
seat of irritation from the internals to the extremities—a
very palpable case in point.</p>

<h3>SETONS.</h3>

<p>The insertion of a seton properly belongs to the professional
man, and only for the guidance of persons
who, from living in remote neighbourhoods or other
causes, cannot possibly procure the assistance of such,
the following information is inserted, in order to obviate
the necessity for some ignorant farrier being permitted
to perform the operation after his own fashion. The
skin is first divided, by surgical scissors made for such
purposes, to the width of the seton-needle to be used,
which must be wide or narrow, according to the orifice
required, with white linen tape passed through its eye,
about the same width as the needle and orifice. The
needle is then inserted at the opening, and, passing
superficially under the skin, is directed towards the
point where the lower or depending orifice is intended
to be, and where the needle and tape are drawn out.
Sufficient tape must be left at each extremity to admit
not only of its being tied round small rolls of tow
which keep the tape from running through at either
side, but some inches of the tape should be left in addition
at one end, to allow of a portion being drawn out
at one orifice each day, and a fresh piece with dressing
being drawn in at the other.</p>

<p>In cases where there is already an upper orifice with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
sinuses, the surgeon (if he does not lay the place entirely
open with a knife, which, if the sinuses are deep-seated,
he will do) will insert the seton-needle at such orifice,
no incision with the scissors being necessary, the direction
of the sinuses having been first ascertained by the
careful use of the probe. The dressing to be applied
to the tape will be either chloride of zinc lotion, Venice
turpentine, or tincture of arnica lotion (<a href="#Page_158"><i>see</i> “Lotions”</a>),
according as the healing or discharging process may
be desired, the first being the healing application.
Farriers attempting this operation will even now adopt
an old and most objectionable practice of tying the two
ends of the seton-tape together, and turning it round
at each fresh dressing; the consequence being that, if
anything happen to catch in the loop thus made, the
whole piece of skin may be dragged out.</p>

Two legs only should be blistered at once, and an interval<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
of three or four days suffered to elapse before the
application of the remaining blisters. The animal’s
head should be tied up for at least thirty hours after
the blister is put on, to prevent his gnawing the part;
but if a cradle round the neck can effect the same purpose
in cases where other parts are blistered, its use is
preferable to tying up the head.</p>

tincture of aconite, ten to twenty drops, in drench of
one pint of water with chill off.</p>

quart of cold water; put this mixture in a stew-pan
containing three quarts of boiling water, stir all well
over the fire till it becomes thick, then leave it aside to
cool sufficiently to be eatable.</p>

<p><i>Disinfectant.</i>—As it will perhaps be useful to any
proprietor of horse-flesh, who may unfortunately have
had contagious disease in his stables, such as farcy or
glanders, to know how premises should be disinfected
according to the most approved means, the following
recommendations of Government for purifying the holds
of ships, during the prevalence of rinderpest, are appended:—</p>

<p><i>Suggestions for Disinfecting Holds of Ships.</i>—The
Government has issued the following circular to the
shipowners and veterinary inspectors of Irish ports.
It must not be forgotten that the importation of raw
hides is still permitted.</p>

<div class="blockquote smaller">

<p class="right">“<i>23d August 1865.</i></p>

<p>“The usual means had recourse to for the purpose of disinfecting
the holds of vessels (such as washing and subsequently
applying diluted disinfecting solutions, the most generally used<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
of which is chloride of lime), do not possess sufficient efficacy,
particularly within the limited time that can be devoted to that
purpose, without interfering with the commercial interests of
the vessels.</p>

<p>“It would occupy too much time to carefully scour and afterwards
apply a disinfecting fluid to the entire surface of a ship’s
hold, in which, generally, there are many crevices and parts
that cannot be reached by the hand or brush. Such crevices
and parts are capable of retaining the contagious and infectious
principles in all their virulence.</p>

<p>“Holds of vessels, and all other chambers from which the
external air can be excluded for a time, can be, comparatively
speaking, most effectually disinfected by filling them with
chlorine gas, the great disinfecting principle of chloride of lime.
The gas insinuates itself into every chink, crevice, and part of
the chamber in which it is confined, and more effectually decomposes
the contagious and infectious compounds, whether
they be solid, fluid, or aeriform, than any other disinfectant
equally easy of application, and as cheap. The mode of disinfecting
the hold of a vessel with chlorine is, to place a quantity
of common salt and black oxide of manganese in a strong basin,
which may be put into a bucket, to the handle of which a rope
has been attached. Pour on the salt and black oxide of manganese
their combined weight of sulphuric acid; then let the
bucket containing the basin a little way down into the hold by
the rope attached to its handle. The chlorine gas, being heavier
than the atmospheric air, will quickly displace the latter and
fill the hold. In a short time, when the hold has become filled
with chlorine, the hatches may be battened down for about half
an hour.</p>

<p>“Previous to using the hold again for live freight, a current
of air should be admitted through it to remove the chlorine.</p>

<p>“Many recommend the use of charcoal; but it is not alone
more difficult of application, but it is much less of a disinfectant
than a deodoriser. Charcoal will not, like the chlorides, decompose
the matter of disease. If the damp matter of glanders, or
sheep-pox, be well mixed with a strong solution of chloride of
lime, it will seldom produce bad effects by inoculation; but if
pure charcoal of any kind be used, the contagious principle of
the diseased matter is not at all diminished in its virulence—quite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
the contrary; similar results are found if cow-pox be the
matter used in the experiment.</p>

<p>“The cost of the readiest materials for the production of
chlorine gas is very trifling. The salt is not ¼d. per pound;
black oxide of manganese but 4d. per pound; and sulphuric
acid 1½d. per pound. These are the retail prices. A couple of
pounds weight of each would suffice for a large-sized hold.</p>

<p>“The attention of the customs, shipowners, and veterinary
inspectors is directed to the above disinfecting means.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> It may be well to let my readers know how I became experienced
on the <i>road</i>. In the days when coaching was in its
perfection (and when many country gentlemen indulged in their
fancy for the use of the “ribbons”), I became, during a long
interval from service, deeply and actively concerned in a
coaching establishment of the first order; and those who, some
years since, travelling between Dublin and Killarney <i>via</i>
Limerick (a distance of about 185 miles), may have happened
to hear coachmen and helpers talking of the “Captain,” will
recognise in the writer the individual thus referred to, who was
also in partnership with the famous Bianconi in the staging on
the Killarney line. Several years spent in such a school will
probably be considered a good apprenticeship to the study of
one branch of the subject herein treated upon—viz., the management
of horses on the road.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> The extremes of various bad positions of the head when the bit
is put in operation are—the throwing up the nose horizontal with
the forehead, a trick denominated “stargazing,” at which ewe-necked
horses are very ready, and getting the bit up to the angles
of the jaws. Such a horse can easily run away, and cannot be
commanded without a martingal. Another bad point is when the
animal leans his jaw firmly against the bit, and, placing his head
between his fore legs, the neck being over-arched, goes where he
pleases: such is called by horsemen “a borer.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> The racer not coming within the province, of this little work, I
will only offer one maxim with reference to such horses in general—viz.,
never race any horse unless you make up your mind to have
most probably a fretful, bad-tempered animal ever after. The
course of training and the excitement of contest will induce such
a result.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> If you happen to buy a low-priced animal, and depend upon
your own opinion as to soundness, it is well to feel and look closely
at the back part of the fore leg, above the fetlock, and along the
pasterns, for cicatrices left after the performance of the operation
of unnerving, by means of which a horse will go perhaps apparently
sound while navicular disease is progressing in his foot, to
terminate in most serious consequences.—<a href="#Page_134"><i>See</i> “Navicular Disease,”

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[11]</a> The famous Irish jumper “Distiller” was notorious among
many other good fencers as a bungler on the road, though he
would jump a six-foot-six stone wall with ease, sporting two large
broken knees in consequence of his performance in that line; and
in fencing he was also first-rate.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="label">[14]</a> All the foregoing observations on saddlery apply equally to
ladies’ saddles. Marked attention should be paid before they mount

from turning, a lady’s weight being often altogether on one side.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="label">[15]</a> As a good shoulder, such as will keep a saddle in its place, is
one of the great essentials in a gentleman’s hack, or indeed in an
officer’s charger, giving him leverage to lift his legs safely and
showily, it stands to reason that not many such will pass into the
ranks at the Government price for remounts, which, however, is
<i>ample</i> to supply animals suitable for the service, and does so in
regiments where the class of horse provided at once proves that the
whole sum allowed is invested in the remount itself, and proper
judgment exercised in purchasing.</p>

Allen’s, in Seymour Place, Bryanstone Square, and Clarendon’s,
in Great Brunswick Street, Dublin, are excellent riding-schools.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="label">[18]</a> Talking of a horse being self-dependent in his movement on the
road, puts me in mind of a challenge once accepted by a very practical
horseman, to ride a notorious stumbler (reduced by this defect
to mere farm-work) three times round Stephen’s Green, Dublin
(a distance of over three miles), without falling. Given his
choice of bits, some being of the severest kind, he rejected them
all, desiring the groom to get him a common hemp halter, and
with this simple head-gear, riding bare-backed, he accomplished
the distance without the slightest mishap, and thereby won a large
bet. The groom, however, resumed the use of the bit to ride the
horse home (now feeling sufficient confidence to trust himself on
his back instead of leading him), when the animal fell on his knees
before he had gone a hundred yards.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="label">[19]</a> The incautious use of that rein, which has leverage on the curb,
is very apt, with young unformed horses, or such as have been only
accustomed to the bridoon or snaffle, to induce a notion of rearing,
especially in anything of a rough attempt to “rein back” with;
indeed, this latter point of training should be accomplished with
the bridoon only.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="label">[20]</a> One can scarcely repress a smile on hearing cross-country misfortunes
related, as they frequently are, in pretty nearly the following
terms:—“I found my horse going sluggishly at his fences;
and one place looking rather biggish, I shook him up with the bit,
and put both heels into him to rouse him, but somehow or other
the brute took off too soon, caught his fore feet, I suppose, against
something, and came such a cropper on the other side!” or, “The
beast kept going at such a bat at his fences that I brought him to
book with my hands down, and with a good pull steadied him; but
the brute with his awkwardness missed his footing on landing,
dropped his hind legs into the brook somehow, and fell back on me,
giving me a regular sousing!”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="label">[21]</a> In obscure lameness, to aid towards discovery of the affected
part, having first decided which leg or foot is diseased, it is not a
bad plan to walk the animal into a stream above the knees and
take him out again (or have water dashed at once fully over the
member), then kneel and closely observe which spot on the surface
dries first—that which does so will probably prove to be the
most inflamed part.</p>

Oxford Street, being an improvement on Mr White’s plan of frosting

<p><a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="label">[27]</a> A suggestion has been made by one of the ablest reviewers of
the first edition of this work, to add a chapter on caprices of horses;
and doubtless such would be so extremely interesting, that the
temptation to insert notes under this head in my first edition was
only overcome by the determination to avoid being led into anecdote,
which has been strictly observed throughout, as being out of keeping
with the concise style in which it was intended that the book
should be produced. A few practical hints are, however, here
classed under the head of “Caprice.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_29" href="#FNanchor_29" class="label">[29]</a> The difference between this disease and attacks of the lower

<p><a id="Footnote_30" href="#FNanchor_30" class="label">[30]</a> Practical men will tell you that the readiest and best way to
mix grey powder, as water will not make it adhere, is with saliva in
the palm of the hand, from whence it is transferred by a blunt knife
to the horse’s tongue near the root, the tongue being drawn out for
the purpose. I can vouch for the efficacy of this not very elegant
proceeding where expedition is an object, having witnessed it
myself.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_31" href="#FNanchor_31" class="label">[31]</a> This will be found almost a specific; it is recommended by Mr
Mayhew, and is said to have originated with Mr Woodyer, V.S., at

repeated doses of iodine or iodide of potassium.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_33" href="#FNanchor_33" class="label">[33]</a> A few of the low class of horsedealers are very clever at passing
off a cribber or wind-sucker.</p>

<p>I have known cases where one might remain in a stable for hours
with a cribber and not detect him. By keeping a continual watch
over the animal and thrashing him directly he attempts to crib, he
has been taught to beware of transgressing in this style in the
presence of any one, and thus even a veterinary surgeon may be
deceived, for he is not supposed to lose his time looking after such
details of trickery.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_34" href="#FNanchor_34" class="label">[34]</a> For example, an animal is in nearly a hopeless state from inflammation
of the lungs and pleura, perhaps as a complication of
distemper. Suddenly there is an amelioration in the symptoms;
the hurried breathing resumes the characteristics of ordinary respiration—the
owner, or veterinary surgeon in attendance, pronounces
the patient to be out of danger—the improvement is regarded
as almost miraculous. But in about twenty-four hours,
often less, the horse is observed to move with difficulty in the
stable; if he lies down, he is disinclined to get up; when standing,
the fore feet are kept considerably more in advance than usual,
the hind ones far forward under the body, so that they may as
much as possible relieve the fore feet and legs from the superincumbent
weight. In aggravated cases, as the heels of the fore feet
are the parts which bear the most weight in progression, the horse,
when forced to walk, which he can only accomplish with great
difficulty, elevates the toe at every step, bringing the heel, instead
of it, to the ground. The horse is then suffering from acute laminitis,
or what is more generally in horse-parlance termed “founder.”</p>
